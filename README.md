# LLM - Detect AI Generated Text (Visual Analytics - UPF)

To **replicate the development environment** simply run the following command (you can change the name of the environment from `vis_analytics` to something else).

```bash
conda env create --name vis_analytics --file environment.yml
conda activate vis_analytics
```

> If yor system does support CUDA, it is recommended to uncomment the `pytorch-cuda` requirement from the `.yml` file and to uncomment the `nvidia` channel.

Alternatively, we also provide a `pip` `requirements.txt` file. Please take into account that the project has been developed with `python 3.11`. We have not tested if the code works with other versions of `python`.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can simply run the [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app as follows:

```bash
streamlit run app/Welcome.py
```

The first execution of the app will download our [pre-trained model](https://huggingface.co/Alejandro-FA/ma_ai_text), the AI-generated text detection model from [SimpleAI](https://huggingface.co/Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-detector-roberta) and some [datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Alejandro-FA/ma_ai_text_data) that we use. Depending on your internet connection this process could take several minutes, please be patient.

These files are too large to be uploaded to GitHub.


## Project description and expected benefits

The goal of the project is to build a classification model that is capable of accurately detecting whether a text has been generated by a LLM or by a student. The purpose of the model is to improve plagiarism detection tools in this new learning context defined by AI. This project has been motivated by [this competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text) hosted in Kaggle.

Since we don't expect to get great accuracy results (especially in such short time), we will put a lot of emphasis in explainable AI. The idea is to build a tool capable of detecting potential plagiarism candidates, and then leave the final call to a human (normally a professor). To help this decision, information about why the model has predicted plagiarism (e.g. using SHAP) will be given to the professor.

## Expected results/delivery/output

The delivery of the project will include:

- Python scripts with:
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis** and feature engineering
    - Training a **Machine Learning model** to classify texts (between AI-generated and human-generated)
    - **Model** performance **evaluation**

- A **streamlit webapp** to present the results and use `Explainable AI` plots to interpret predictions.

## Visualization method

We will build a Streamlit webapp to present the methodologies used, the analysis of the data, the Machine Learning model and an interpretation of the results (Explainable AI). We will design the webapp with the goal of using storytelling techniques for the presentation.
