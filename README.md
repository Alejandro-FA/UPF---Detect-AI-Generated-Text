# LLM - Detect AI Generated Text (Visual Analytics - UPF)

Kaggle competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text

To **replicate the development environment** simply run the following command (you can change the name of the environment from `vis_analytics` to something else).

```bash
conda env create --name vis_analytics --file environment.yml
```

> If yor system does not support CUDA, you should first remove the `pytorch-cuda` requirement from the `.yml` file, otherwise the environment creation will fail.


## Project description and expected benefits

The goal of the project is to build a classification model that is capable of accurately detecting whether a text has been generated by a LLM or by a student. The purpose of the model is to improve plagiarism detection tools in this new learning context defined by AI.

Since we don't expect to get great accuracy results (especially in such short time), we will put a lot of emphasis in explainable AI. The idea is to build a tool capable of detecting potential plagiarism candidates, and then leave the final call to a human (normally a professor). To help this decision, information about why the model has predicted plagiarism (e.g. using SHAP) will be given to the professor.

## Expected results/delivery/output

The delivery of the project will include:

- One Python Jupyter Notebook with:
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis** and feature engineering
    - **Machine Learning model** to classify texts (between AI generated and human generated)

- An additional Python Jupyter Notebook with **Explainable AI analysis tools**.

- A **streamlit webapp** to present the results.

## Visualization method

We will build a Streamlit webapp to present the methodologies used, the analysis of the data, the Machine Learning model and an interpretation of the results (Explainable AI). We will design the webapp with the goal of using storytelling techniques for the presentation.
