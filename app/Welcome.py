        "The goal of the project is to build a classification model that is capable of accurately detecting whether a text has been generated by a LLM or by a student. The purpose of the model is to improve plagiarism detection tools in this new learning context defined by AI. Since we don't expect to get great accuracy results (especially in such short time), we will put a lot of emphasis in explainable AI. The idea is to build a tool capable of detecting potential plagiarism candidates, and then leave the final call to a human (normally a professor). To help this decision, information about why the model has predicted plagiarism (e.g. using SHAP) will be given to the professor."
