"This paper tackles the problem of millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel estimation in massive MIMO communication systems. A new Bayes-optimal channel estimator is derived using recent advances in the approximate belief propagation Bayesian inference paradigm. By leveraging the inherent sparsity of the mmWave MIMO channel in the angular domain, we recast the underlying channel estimation problem into that of reconstructing a compressible signal from a set of noisy linear measurements. Then, the generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm is used to find the entries of the unknown mmWave MIMO channel matrix. Unlike all the existing works on the same topic, we model the angular-domain channel coefficients by Laplacian distributed random variables. Furthermore, we establish the closed-form expressions for the various statistical quantities that need to be updated iteratively by GAMP. To render the proposed algorithm fully automated, we also develop an expectation-maximization (EM) based procedure that can be easily embedded within GAMP's iteration loop in order to learn all the unknown parameters of the underlying Bayesian inference problem. The computer simulations show that the proposed combined EM-GAMP algorithm under a Laplacian prior exhibits improvements both in terms of channel estimation accuracy, achievable rate, and computational complexity, as compared to the Gaussian mixture prior that has been advocated in the recent literature. In addition, it is found that the Laplacian prior speeds up the convergence time of GAMP over the entire signal-to-noise ratio range.",0,CHEAT
"Safety assurance in critical IoT systems is increasingly important as those systems are becoming ubiquitous in various application areas, such as health care and transportation. Recently, novel runtime monitoring approaches started to adapt expressive rule- or query-based languages to capture safety properties, which are evaluated over runtime models. In this paper, we define two distributed query-based runtime monitoring strategies for IoT and cyber-physical systems built on top of a distributed runtime model deployed over the Data Distribution Service as standard communication middleware. We provide detailed scalability evaluation of our prototype implementation over a case study motivated by an open-source IoT demonstrator.",0,CHEAT
"Cyanobacterial blooms increasingly pose threats to ecosystems and human health. This paper is aimed to propose systematic risk pre-control schemes by understanding the complex causalities between cyanobacteria and multiple influencing variables. This research remains a challenge for three reasons. Firstly, the time-series evolution of cyanobacteria is characterized by deep uncertainties and nonlinear dynamics. Secondly, latent variables with hidden information usually exist in this kind of complex aquatic system. Thirdly, it is difficult to identify an efficient pre-control scheme that specifies variables for preferential regulation. To address these problems, we propose a latent variable structured Bayesian network model and a corresponding parameter learning algorithm. The model is tested by real-time spatio-temporal data. The computational results reveal that the proposed model demonstrates better performance in terms of inference accuracy and degree of system understanding. Based on sensitivity analysis and combination-effect analysis, a systematic risk pre-control scheme is proposed for decision-makers to prevent cyanobacterial blooms under the scenario of global warming.",0,CHEAT
"Daily human activity recognition using sensor data can be a fundamental task for many real-world applications, such as home monitoring and assisted living. One of the challenges in human activity recognition is to distinguish activities that have infrequent occurrence and less distinctive patterns. We propose a dissimilarity representation-based hierarchical classifier to perform two-phase learning. In the first phase, the classifier learns general features to recognise majority classes, and the second phase is to collect minority and subtle classes to identify fine difference between them. We compare our approach with a collection of state-of-the-art classification techniques on a real-world third-party dataset that is collected in a two-user home setting. Our results demonstrate that our hierarchical classifier approach outperforms the existing techniques in distinguishing users in performing the same type of activities. The key novelty of our approach is the exploration of dissimilarity representations and hierarchical classifiers, which allows us to highlight the difference between activities with subtle difference, and thus allows the identification of well-discriminating features.",0,CHEAT
"The paper proposes a bio-inspired model for an imitative sensorimotor learning, which aims at building a map between the sensory representations of gestures (sensory targets) and their underlying motor pattern through random exploration of the motor space. An example of such learning process occurs during vocal learning in humans or birds, when young subjects babble and learn to copy previously heard adult vocalizations. Previous work has suggested that a simple Hebbian learning rule allows perfect imitation when sensory feedback is a purely linear function of the motor pattern underlying movement production. We aim at generalizing this model to the more realistic case where sensory responses are sparse and non-linear. To this end, we explore the performance of various learning rules and normalizations and discuss their biological relevance. Importantly, the proposed model is robust whatever normalization is chosen. We show that both the imitation quality and the convergence time are highly dependent on the sensory selectivity and dimension of the motor representation.",0,CHEAT
"In pig production, food processing and profitability ratios can be assessed by detecting live weight of live pigs in real time. Traditional pig weight detection often requires direct contact with pigs, which is limited by low efficiency and can result in even death. Detecting the weight of non-contact pigs has become a challenge in pig production for decades. The proposed system offers significant features such as color, texture, centroid, major axis length, minor axis length, eccentricity and area. For recognition for estimation weight of pig, we use statistics from the original database with neural network. Analysis of experimental results of contactless pig weight estimation as well.",0,CHEAT
"This paper addresses the sensitivity analysis of an extended and dual Kalman filters used for state estimation (state of charge (SoC), inner resistance) of lithium-ion batteries mainly for traction applications. The Kalman filters in different configurations are now widely applied in modern battery management systems. It is well known that the quality of estimation is dependent from the accuracy of model used. In this case a compromise between model's complexity and quality of estimation is one of main critical factors while developing a Kalman filter based estimation solution. In case of state estimation of lithium-ion batteries this point becomes important due to the following reasons: transformation of chemical effects to electrical model causes the loss of model accuracy; model parameters are not constant due to ageing and temperature rice; parameters of derived discrete time models are sensitive to measurement noise. In this paper authors analyse the influence of varying inner parameters of a lithium-ion battery and the choice of time discrete model onto accuracy of SoC estimation. An extended and dual discrete Kalman filter using zero-order hold method and Tustin transform are tested using new European driving cycle.",0,CHEAT

"Living in the world of convergence where the demand for cloud storage has rapidly increased. This is due to vast amounts of data need to be stored and shared between multiple people via internet or intranet connection. It is essential for making it efficient and effective. Although existing cloud storage provides a number of features and capabilities, such as reliability where the user can access various resources despite location and time, there are still some drawbacks or gap in managing the unlimited resources. Hence, it is undeniable that, the most important feature that a cloud storage should possess is a smart data sharing management. In order to overcome such implication, virtual Intelligent Dynamic Data Cloud Center (ViDaC) application are proposed to fill the gap. Virtual Intelligent Dynamic Data Cloud Center (ViDaC) application is the smart data sharing management system which will not only able to manage data smartly, it will also assist in validating and ensure each content of the data or document submitted should fulfil the given conditions and specifications. Failure in abating the problems in cloud storage data management will not only affect the quality of productivity but will also invoke various critical management issues in an organization. Therefore, ViDaC is the solution to provide a better environment for managing data and so all the limitless resources can be supervised and coordinate effectively.

"The threat of radio frequency jamming attack to cognitive radio network is an issue that has been discussed for a long time. Q-learning is a widely used anti-jamming algorithm due to its model-free characteristic. However, the traditional Q-learning based anti-jamming algorithms suffer from some limitations when dealing with high-dimensional or continuous inputs. The recently proposed double Deep Q-learning Network (DQN) overcomes this weakness by approximating the table based Q function with a deep neural network. In this paper, we apply the double DQN algorithm with frequency hopping strategy against RF jamming attack in a multi-user environment. We test the performances of three types of neural networks which are the fully connected network (FCN), the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short term memory (LSTM). The simulation shows the effectiveness of the double DQN algorithm. Meanwhile, the FCN agent gives the best result concerning stability.",0,CHEAT
"The response speed of a network impacts the efficacy of its actions to external stimuli. However, for a given bound on the update rate, the network-response speed is limited by the need to maintain stability. This work increases the network-response speed without having to increase the update rate by using delayed self-reinforcement (DSR), where each agent uses its already available information from the network to strengthen its individual update law. Example simulation results are presented that show more than an order of magnitude improvement in the response speed (quantified using the settling time) with the proposed DSR approach.",0,CHEAT
"With the rise of social networking and the awareness of privacy protection, the large-scale positioning data is getting harder to access while the clickstream data of social networking is accumulating. It is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study on the temporal property and spatial distribution of social network's clickstream to determine the latent relationship between clickstream and location semantics which semantically annotate locations to help us understand the purpose of a social network user at a certain location and a particular time. In this paper, we first infer the location semantics from Internet logs as our baseline which is a large scale, imprecise positioning mobile dataset through combining the utilization of derived time pattern and speed pattern. Then we design a method to reconstruct location semantics through the social network. We are the first to our knowledge that define “click motif” of social network's clickstream which is the combination of clicks in clickstream that occurs repeatedly and has significance. Click motif not only can help us to classify location semantics but also enhance the user experience of social networking. Besides, we propose a completed process to extract typical click motifs from a large-scale complicated clickstream data via embedding and clustering method. By extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that different combination of click motifs can convey the users' location semantics, therefore clickstream may disclose location privacy.",0,CHEAT
"Learning the correlation among labels is a standing-problem in the multi-label image recognition task. The label correlation is the key to solve the multi-label classification but it is too abstract to model. Most solutions try to learn image label dependencies to improve multi-label classification performance. However, they have ignored two more realistic problems: object scale inconsistent and label tail (category imbalance). These two problems will impact the bad influence on the classification model. To tackle these two problems and learn the label correlations, we propose feature attention network (FAN) which contains feature refinement network and correlation learning network. FAN builds top-down feature fusion mechanism to refine more important features and learn the correlations among convolutional features from FAN to indirect learn the label dependencies. Following our proposed solution, we achieve performed classification accuracy on MSCOCO 2014 and VOC 2007 dataset.",0,CHEAT

Also, the task of advanced prediction of the character which little research has been worked on is the key point. With the information of stroke order and some data augmentation strategy, methods proposed have achieved satisfying results.",0,CHEAT
"This paper investigates the problem of sliding mode observer (SMO) design for Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy descriptor fractional order systems (FOSs) with fractional order $0<; \alpha <; 1$.

By utilizing the fuzzy sliding surface, the assumption that all local input matrices are identical in most existing results about sliding mode control (SMC) for T-S fuzzy systems, can be removed. Then, a new sufficient condition is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which guarantees the admissibility of the sliding mode dynamics. Moreover, adaptive SMC strategy is used such that the reachability condition can be guaranteed. Finally, three examples are given to verify the effectiveness of our results.",0,CHEAT
"A key challenge in renal diagnosis using digital pathology has been the scarcity of reliable annotated datasets that can act as a benchmark for histological investigations. This paper uses a novel medical image dataset, titled Glomeruli Classification Database (GCDB), consisting of renal glomeruli images bifurcated into binary classes of normal and abnormal morphology. Based on this dataset, we direct our pioneering efforts to explore suitable deep neural network techniques related to kidney tissue slide imaging so as to establish a state of the art in this relatively unexplored domain. The paper focuses on classifying normal and abnormal categories of glomeruli which are the vital blood filtration units of the kidney. The results obtained using publicly available transfer learning models are held in comparison with supervised classifiers configured with image features extracted from the last layers of pre-trained image classifiers.

"This paper presents the development and validation of a new oscillatory component load (OCL) model for a measurement-based real-time estimation of dynamic load model parameters. The proposed OCL model has been derived from a second-order differential equation that considers three necessary components, namely static, exponential recovery, and damped oscillatory components. The performance evaluation of the proposed OCL model has been demonstrated through DIgSILENT PowerFactory-based dynamic power system simulations, real-time substation data captured from phasor measurement units located at the primary substations of Leadenham, Holwell, and Regent Street cities, and real-time transient voltage events data provided by the EirGrid. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed OCL model has been assessed by comparing its performance with that of the existing exponential recovery load model. A new flexible and efficient SynchroHub platform, developed at the University of Manchester for real-time data acquisition, processing and visualization, has been used for the real-time estimation of dynamic load model parameters.

"The distributed cubature Kalman filter is widely used in the field of target tracking, however, the presence of model uncertainties will undermine its tracking stability and effectiveness for tracking maneuvering target. In order to eliminate this effect on maneuvering target tracking, this paper develops a distributed consensus based strong tracking cubature Kalman filter scheme. First, each node obtains its local estimation with the usage of local observations via strong tracking cubature Kalman filter, where the suboptimal fading factor and adaptive factor are introduced for adaptively modifying the filter gain. Then, the designed filter gain is used for updating the local state estimation. Second, after all, nodes have achieved its local estimation, each node exchanges its local estimation to its neighbors and updates its local estimation according to the consensus communication protocol. It can be further proved that the distributed interaction between neighbors will contribute to enhancing the tracking stability. The detailed proof for stochastic boundedness of the estimation error is analyzed by introducing a stochastic process. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher tracking accuracy than the existing methods for tracking a maneuvering target.",0,CHEAT
"Wireless Sensor Network is one of the major areas in wireless communications which extend its application in military, security, internet and scientific purposes.

This encourages the investigation of the effect of the number of simulation replications on the performance of the optimization algorithm, in terms of the solution fidelity versus the computational cost. Existing simulation replication strategies with optimization algorithms have been proposed utilizing a single probability distribution to fit their parameter settings for solving stochastic simulation problems.

"Concept drift is a known phenomenon in software data analytics. It refers to the changes in the data distribution over time. The performance of analytic and prediction models degrades due to the changes in the data over time. To improve prediction performance, most studies propose that the prediction model be updated when concept drift occurs. In this work, we investigate the existence of concept drift and its associated effects on software defect prediction performance. We adopt the strategy of an empirically proven method DDM (Drift Detection Method) and evaluate its statistical significance using the chi-square test with Yates continuity correction. The objective is to empirically determine the concept drift and to calibrate the base model accordingly. The empirical study indicates that the concept drift occurs in software defect datasets, and its existence subsequently degrades the performance of prediction models. Two types of concept drifts (gradual and sudden drifts) were identified using the chi-square test with Yates continuity correction in the software defect datasets studied. We suggest concept drift should be considered by software quality assurance teams when building prediction models.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, a nonlinear parallel control algorithm is developed for an electro-hydraulic actuator to achieve high velocity tracking performance and reduce energy consumption. The parallel control system consists of a servo valve and a variable displacement pump. A separate strategy is employed for practical use. The variable displacement pump is considered as feedforward according to velocity commands and leakage; while the servo valve is used to improve the dynamics and accuracy of the closed loop system.

This IoT-based insulation condition monitoring is proven to be applicable for the distribution grid and expected to be referenced for more possible IoT applications.",0,CHEAT
"Document retrieval (DR) forms an important component in end-to-end question-answering (QA) systems where particular answers are sought for well-formed questions. DR in the QA scenario is also useful by itself even without a more involved natural language processing component to extract exact answers from the retrieved documents. This latter step may simply be done by humans like in traditional search engines granted the retrieved documents contain the answer. In this paper, we take advantage of datasets made available through the BioASQ end-to-end QA shared task series and build an effective biomedical DR system that relies on relevant answer snippets in the BioASQ training datasets. At the core of our approach is a question-answer sentence matching neural network that learns a measure of relevance of a sentence to an input question in the form of a matching score. In addition to this matching score feature, we also exploit two auxiliary features for scoring document relevance: the name of the journal in which a document is published and the presence/absence of semantic relations (subject-predicate-object triples) in a candidate answer sentence connecting entities mentioned in the question. We rerank our baseline sequential dependence model scores using these three additional features weighted via adaptive random research and other learning-to-rank methods. Our full system placed 2nd in the final batch of Phase A (DR) of task B (QA) in BioASQ 2018. Our ablation experiments highlight the significance of the neural matching network component in the full system.",0,CHEAT
"Based on the high-order difference co-array concept, an enhanced four-level nested array (E-FL-NA) is first proposed, which optimizes the consecutive lags at the fourth-order difference co-array stage. To simplify sensor location formulations for comprehensive illustration and also convenient structure construction, a simplified and enhanced four-level nested array (SE-FL-NA) is then proposed, whose performance is compromised but still better than the four-level nested array (FL-NA). This simplified structure is further extended to the higher order case with multiple sub-arrays, referred to as simplified and enhanced multiple level nested arrays (SE-ML-NAs), where significantly increased degrees of freedom can be provided and exploited for underdetermined direction of arrival estimation. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed E-FL-NA, whereas a higher number of detectable sources is achieved by the SE-ML-NA with a limited number of physical sensors.",0,CHEAT
"Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals exhibit highly irregular patterns. This irregularity, which arises from i.i.d. measurement noise, has been partially resolved by memoryless classifiers, such as deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, there are other major sources of irregularity, including brain network modes, mental states, and various physiological factors. These internal states drift over time, in which case it would be better to use memory-based neural networks, such as long short-term memory networks (LSTM). This paper presents a novel EEG signal classification framework that resolves a trade-off between memoryless and memory-based classification. The proposed method uses deep reinforcement learning (RL) to find a trial-by-trial control strategy for the attention control system that switches between CNN (memoryless) and LSTM (memory-based)-or is a mixture of both. The simulation on the EEG dataset, which was collected while performing a complex cognitive task, shows that the proposed attention control system outperforms other EEG classification methods.",0,CHEAT
"Automatic detection of mandibular canal in cone beam CT data is an essential step for planning and guiding implant surgery. In this work, we present a new detection method based on combining statistical shape models and Lie group. The proposed methodology consists of three steps. Firstly, a method based on multi-scale low rank matrix decomposition is used for noise removal and image enhancement. Subsequently, a Lie group based statistical shape model is constructed to represent shape variation and fast marching is employed to localize the location of the mandibular canal more accurately. Quantitative results show that accurate and fully automatic detection of mandibular canal is feasible. Moreover, the proposed method based on Lie group based statistical shape model outperforms two previous methods based on statistical shape model in the literature, i.e. conventional and conditional statistical shape models. The average value of Dice similarity index and symmetric distance are 0.92 and 1.02 mm, respectively.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, a non-linear control technique and an artificial intelligent controller are presented and applied to a single-phase, grid-connected PV system based on the current source inverter (CSI) topology. These techniques are investigated in order to assure a good performance of CSI in term of total harmonic distortion (THD). The design of the non-linear controller is based on the Sliding mode control (SMC) approach to establish the inverter control laws. An analysis based on Lyapunov stability approach is developed to guarantee the global asymptotic stability of the system. The intelligent controller is based on the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to generate a reference signal. A conventional regulator PI is used in input and output of the FLC to improve the performance. Both control techniques are used to control the injected current and synchronize it with the network. This paper performs a comparative performance evaluation of both approaches. The analytical expectations of the systems are verified using MATLAB/Simulink software environment.",0,CHEAT
"Applications of wireless sensor networks span from the agricultural field to the battlefield and from smart city to smart city health care. There are certain applications where millions of sensor nodes or motes are deployed to sense the environmental parameters. However, in certain applications like health care and smart city applications, few hundreds of nodes can solve the purpose. Routing in energy-constrained networks like WSN is a challenging task. Parameters like consumed energy, congestion and signal to noise ratio etc. are considered to find a routing path in WSN. The Survival Path Routing (SPR) protocol is an earlier version of the work proposed here. The said protocol fails to provide a better result when the number of nodes in the network is increased. Thus a Scalable Survival Path Routing (SSPR) protocol is proposed where the method of clustering is applied to meet the efficiency of a scalable network. Weights of the nodes are computed to choose the cluster heads among them. It is observed that the proposed protocol SSPR outperforms SPR and Directed Diffusion protocol in terms of packet delivery ratio, end to end delay and throughput.",0,CHEAT
"Simulation of neural networks is a significant task for contemporary artificial intelligence research. Despite the availability of modern processing hardware, the task is still too demanding to be done in a sequential way. Therefore, a parallel computation approach is almost always necessary. Modern graphical accelerators (GPUs) represent highly parallel machines with a significant computational performance that can be unleashed only under certain conditions including threads scheduling, proper sources occupation, aligned data access, communication management, etc. We have proposed a novel acceleration approach for large neural networks.

"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be used for providing seamless network coverage in urban areas for improving the performance of conventional cellular networks. Given the predominantly line-of-sight channel of drones, UAV-aided seamless coverage becomes particularly beneficial in case of emergency situations. However, a single UAV having a limited cruising capability is unable to provide seamless long-term coverage, multiple drones relying on sophisticated recharging and reshuffling schemes are necessary. In this context, both the positioning and the flight strategy directly affect the efficiency of the system. Hence, we first introduce a novel UAV energy consumption model, based on which an energy-efficiency-based objective function is derived. Second, we propose an energy-efficient rechargeable UAV deployment strategy optimized under a seamless coverage constraint. Explicitly, a two-stage joint optimization algorithm is conceived for solving both the optimal UAV deployment and the cyclic UAV recharging and reshuffling strategy. Our simulation results quantify the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.",0,CHEAT
"Autonomic optical transmission and networking requires machine learning (ML) models to be trained with large datasets. However, the availability of enough real data to produce accurate ML models is rarely ensured since new optical equipment and techniques are continuously being deployed in the network. One option is to generate data from simulations and lab experiments, but such data could not cover the whole features space and would translate into inaccuracies in the ML models. In this paper, we propose an ML-based algorithm life cycle to facilitate ML deployment in real operator networks. The dataset for ML training can be initially populated based on the results from simulations and lab experiments. Once ML models are generated, ML retraining can be performed after inaccuracies are detected to improve their precision. Illustrative numerical results show the benefits of the proposed learning cycle for general use cases. In addition, two specific use cases are proposed and demonstrated that implement different learning strategies: (i) a two-phase strategy performing out-of-field training using data from simulations and lab experiments with generic equipment, followed by an in-field adaptation to support heterogeneous equipment (the accuracy of this strategy is shown for a use case of failure detection and identification), and (ii) in-field retraining, where ML models are retrained after detecting model inaccuracies. Different approaches are analyzed and evaluated for a use case of autonomic transmission, where results show the significant benefits of collective learning.",0,CHEAT
"The reliability and lifetime determine the levelized cost of energy (LOCE) of photovoltaic (PV) modules and effectiveness of PV system. Although this theme has attracted researchers attention in recent years, there still lack an effective method to model PV modules power degradation. Therefore, this paper put forward to adopt gamma process to establish the relationship between PV modules power degradation, and temperature, relative humidity (RH). And then PV modules service lifetime is predicted under accelerated damp-heat conditions. Firstly, accelerated damp-heat tests are carried out on three different temperature and RH levels. Based on Peck model, a data transformed method is proposed to obtain more power degradation data under other seven damp-heat conditions. Secondly, gamma process with an exponential transformation is applied to model PV modules power degradation under accelerated damp-heat conditions. The relationship between power degradation and temperature, RH is established by theoretical derivation and validated by experimental data. Then Expectation Maximum (EM) algorithm is proposed to estimate model's parameters. Finally, PV modules lifetime under several different damp-heat conditions is predicted. It is found that PV modules lifetime is approximate 20 to 25 years under (50°/45% RH) condition. But we also conclude that PV modules lifetime sharply decreases as the increment of temperature and RH. Hence, more factors or other test types are recommended to be considered in later accelerated tests.",0,CHEAT

"Within the context of trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles this paper proposes methods for efficient encoding of motion primitives in neural networks on top of model-based and gradient-free reinforcement learning. It is distinguished between 5 core aspects: system model, network architecture, training algorithm, training tasks selection and hardware/software implementation. For the system model, a kinematic (3-states-2-controls) and a dynamic (16-states-2-controls) vehicle model are compared. For the network architecture, 3 feedforward structures are compared including weighted skip connections. For the training algorithm, virtual velocity constraints and network scheduling are proposed. For the training tasks, different feature vector selections are discussed. For the implementation, aspects of gradient-free learning using 1 GPU and the handling of perturbation noise therefore are discussed. The effects of proposed methods are illustrated in experiments encoding up to 14625 motion primitives. The capabilities of tiny neural networks with as few as 10 scalar parameters when scheduled on vehicle velocity are emphasized.",0,CHEAT
"Blockchain has been widely recognized as the trust machine underpinning the Internet of Things(IoT). However, the poor performance of the existing mainstream platforms renders this expectation unattainable. New technologies like DAG and Hashgraph emerge as promising candidates to address the pressing issues, but their abilities in decentralized consensus are still in question. We propose a 3D-DAG model to address the trilemma of decentralization, scalability and security.

"This paper presents a new methodology to extract the unknown parameters of a single-diode photovoltaic (PV) cell model. The first contribution of this paper is the development and implementation of a new version of the wind-driven optimization algorithm, called an adaptive wind-driven optimization (AWDO) algorithm. The advantages of the AWDO algorithm are: 1) accurate extraction of the global values of the optimized PV parameters in changing weather conditions, which is achieved by building solutions from random operations; and 2) capability of handling the given complex multi-modal and multi-dimensional optimization problems. The second contribution is the identification of a generalization model to generalize the extracted parameters of a single-diode PV cell model. That provides an ability of the proposed methodology to work with any I-V characteristic curve of PV cells and at any weather condition on a 15-min basis. To validate the proposed methodology, it has been tested for 1307 I-V characteristic curves of a PV module at various weather conditions on a 15-min basis. Additionally, its accuracy and computational efficiency are verified and compared with five well-known existing extraction methods: Villalva's model, particle swarm optimization, biogeography-based optimization, Gang's model, and bacterial foraging optimization by both simulation and outdoor measurements. The results show that the AWDO algorithm can provide the extracted five parameters with an acceptable range of accuracy and faster than the aforementioned models. Therefore, the proposed methodology (AWDO based on Chenlo's model) can be confidently recommended as a reliable, feasible, valuable, and fast optimization algorithm for parameter extraction of a single-diode PV cell model.",0,CHEAT
"With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies, people find more and more blockchain applications in the IoT domain.

From IoT blockchain design perspective, it is important to understand the scalability of the energy consumption feature of IoT blockchains. In our research we have collected real-world data that reflect the energy consumption features of several consensus algorithms of blockchain.

"Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) have recently attracted a lot of attention due to their immense potentials and applications. Wide range of coverage and accessibility to end users make VANETs a good target for commercial companies. In this paper, we consider a scenario in which advertising companies aim to disseminate their advertisements in different areas of a city by utilizing VANETs infrastructure. These companies compete for renting the VANETs infrastructure to spread their advertisements. We partition the city map into different blocks, and consider a manager for all the blocks who is in charge of splitting the time between interested advertising companies. Each advertising company (AdC) is charged proportional to the allocated time. In order to find the best time splitting between AdCs, we propose a Stackelberg game scheme in which the block manager assigns the companies to the blocks and imposes the renting prices to different companies in order to maximize its own profit. Based on this, AdCs request the amount of time they desire to rent the infrastructure in order to maximize their utilities. To obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game, a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem is solved using the proposed optimal and sub-optimal algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate that the sub-optimal algorithm approaches the optimal one in performance with lower complexity.",0,CHEAT
"We provide a novel framework for the synthesis of a controller for a robot with a surveillance objective, that is, the robot is required to maintain knowledge of the location of a moving, possibly adversarial target. We formulate this problem as a one-sided partial-information game in which the winning condition for the agent is specified as a temporal logic formula. The specification formalizes the surveillance requirement given by the user by quantifying and reasoning over the agent's beliefs about a target's location. We also incorporate additional non-surveillance tasks. In order to synthesize a surveillance strategy that meets the specification, we transform the partial-information game into a perfect-information one, using abstraction to mitigate the exponential blow-up typically incurred by such transformations. This transformation enables the use of off-the-shelf tools for reactive synthesis. We evaluate the proposed method on two case-studies, demonstrating its applicability to diverse surveillance requirements.",0,CHEAT
"Deep learning techniques have shown promising outcomes in single image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction from noisy and blurry low resolution data. The SR reconstruction can cater the fundamental limitations of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging to potentially attain a balance among the trade-offs like imaging-speed, spatial/temporal resolution, and dose/exposure-time, which is often difficult to achieve simultaneously otherwise. In this work, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, utilizing both local and global skip connections, aiming for 4× SR reconstruction of TEM images. We used exact image pairs of a calibration grid to generate our training and independent testing datasets. The results are compared and discussed using models trained on synthetic (downsampled) and real data from the calibration grid. We also compare the variants of the proposed network with well-known classical interpolations techniques. Finally, we investigate the domain adaptation capacity of the CNN-based model by testing it on TEM images of a cilia sample, having different image characteristics as compared to the calibration-grid.",0,CHEAT

"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used and have achieved great success in computer vision and speech processing applications. However, deploying the large-scale CNN model in the embedded system is subject to the constraints of computation and memory. An optimized block-floating-point (BFP) arithmetic is adopted in our accelerator for efficient inference of deep neural networks in this paper. The feature maps and model parameters are represented in 16-bit and 8-bit formats, respectively, in the off-chip memory, which can reduce memory and off-chip bandwidth requirements by 50% and 75% compared to the 32-bit FP counterpart. The proposed 8-bit BFP arithmetic with optimized rounding and shifting-operation-based quantization schemes improves the energy and hardware efficiency by three times.

"Early childhood is a significant period when transitions take place in children. This period is a hot topic among researchers who pursue this domain across different scientific disciplines. Many studies addressed social, scientific, medical, and technical topics during early childhood. Researchers also utilized different analysis measures to conduct experiments on the different types of data related to the early childhood to produce research articles. This paper aims to review and analyze the literature related to early childhood in addition to the data analyses and the types of data used. The factors that were considered to boost the understanding of contextual aspects in the published studies related to early childhood were considered as open challenges, motivations, and recommendations of researchers who aimed to advance the study in this area of science. We systematically searched articles on topics related to early childhood, the data analysis approaches used, and the types of data applied. The search was conducted on five major databases, namely, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed from 2013 to September 2017. These indices were considered sufficiently extensive and reliable to cover our field of the literature. Articles were selected on the basis of our inclusion and exclusion criteria (n = 233). The first portion of studies (n = 103/233) focused on the different aspects related to the development of children in early age. They discussed different topics, such as the body growth development of children, psychology, skills, and other related topics that overlap between two or more of the previous topics or do not fall into any of the categories but are still under development. The second portion of studies (n = 107/233) focused on different aspects associated with health in early childhood. A number of topics were discussed in this regard, such as those related to family health, medical procedures, interventions, and risk that address the health-related aspects, in addition to other related topics that overlap between two or more of the previous topics or do not fall into any of the categories but are still under health. The remaining studies (n = 23/233) were categorized to the other main category because they overlap between the previous two major categories, namely, development and health, or they do not fall into any of the previous main categories. Early childhood is a sensitive period in every child's life. This period was studied using different means of data analysis and with the aid of different data types to produce different findings from the previous studies. Research areas on early childhood vary, but they are equally significant. This paper emphasizes the current standpoint and opportunities for research in this area and boosts additional efforts toward the understanding of this research field.",0,CHEAT
"There are two fundamental purposes in mobile edge computing, i.e., performance enhancement and cost reduction. By offloading computation tasks to a mobile edge cloud (MEC), a user equipment (UE), also called mobile user, mobile subscriber, or mobile device, can possibly reduce its average response time, which is the main performance measure, and can possibly reduce its average power consumption. Optimizing both performance and cost may be conflicting requirements. In this paper, we optimize the cost-performance ratio (CPR), i.e., the power-time product, which combines performance (average response time) and cost (average power consumption) into one quantity. A unique feature in mobile edge computing is the competitiveness of mobile users, who are selfish in competing for resources in a mobile edge cloud. We take a game theoretic approach to the stabilization of a competitive mobile edge computing environment. The main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows. 1) We consider a mobile edge computing environment with multiple UEs and a single MEC. We establish an M/G/1 queueing model for the UEs and an M/G/m queueing model for the MEC. The UEs are entirely heterogeneous in terms of task characteristics, computation and communication speeds, and power consumption models for both computation and communication. 2) We analytically derive the average response time and the average power consumption of each UE and the MEC, so that cost-performance ratio optimization can be studied mathematically and rigorously. 3) We establish a non-cooperative game framework to systematically study the stabilization of a competitive mobile edge computing environment. Our framework includes a set of seven non-cooperative games among the UEs and the MEC, each attempts to minimize its payoff function, i.e., its cost-performance ratio. These games are different in terms of the number of variables to play and which variables to play. 4) We develop efficient algorithms for each player to find the best response in each game. All these algorithms are the poly-log time in the length of an initial search interval and the accuracy requirement. We also develop an iterative algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium of the games. 5) We demonstrate the numerical examples of our algorithms and performance data of our games for the idle-speed model and the constant-speed model respectively.",0,CHEAT
"Beamforming techniques play an important role in multi-antenna communication systems and this work focuses on the downlink power minimization problem under a set of quality of service constraints. Conventional iterative algorithms can obtain optimal solutions but at the cost of high computational delay. Fast beamforming can be achieved by leveraging the powerful deep learning techniques. In this work, we propose a beamforming neural network (BNN), based on convolutional neural networks and exploitation of expert knowledge, for the power minimization problem. Instead of estimating beamforming matrix directly, we predict key features using the BNN which takes complex channel as input. Then the beamforming matrix is recovered from the predictions according to the uplink-downlink duality. The BNN adopts the supervised learning method with a loss function based on the mean-squared error metric to update network parameters. Simulation results show the BNN can achieve satisfactory performance with low computational delay.",0,CHEAT
"The Product Quality Accident (PQA) is a kind of accident mainly caused by product quality defects originated in design and production. To decrease the number and the severity of PQA in usage is a routine task of quality and reliability engineer. Especially with the advent of the era of intelligent manufacturing and big data, the functional structure of product is becoming increasingly complicated and the dimension of big data in product lifecycle is high. As a result, it is difficult to artificially identify the root cause of PQA by traditional method. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method based on an advanced data mining algorithm for root cause identification. Firstly, the quality accident formation mechanism is introduced in detail. Secondly, with the aid of the domain mapping theory, PQA relevance tree is contributed. Thirdly, with the setting of reasonable support and confidence, the FP-Growth algorithm is used to further mine the relevance rules and construct a complete PQA relevance tree, which could reduce the ambiguity of PQA root cause identification. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified by a root cause analysis example of an engine quality accident.",0,CHEAT
"CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) enables embedded devices to offer RESTful Web Services and exchange small binary message headers. Next to the transmission of sensor data and control information between smart home devices, there is an application field of streaming data using CoAP. There are CoAP implementations available in Java, that allow an execution on heterogeneous devices and operating systems due to the Java Virtual Machine and Java Runtime Environment. Because of the timing demands of live streaming applications in terms of low latency communication at application layer, we evaluate two different CoAP Java implementations. We compare the timing fluctuations of the packet processing with a CoAP C implementation. As a conclusion we identify the Java Garbage Collector to cause large fluctuations of the packet processing, which results in bad suitability for a live streaming scenario. Furthermore, we recommend the usage of native code applications because of better timing results.",0,CHEAT
"Lightning electromagnetic pulse (LEMP) waveforms associated with lightning strikes to the 634-m high Tokyo Skytree are calculated by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method in the two-dimensional (2-D) cylindrical coordinate. The three-dimensional (3-D) tortuous lightning channel and the tall strike object are represented by an “equivalent vertical” phased-current-source array. The current propagation speed along the equivalent vertical lighting channel is determined in two steps: first, the channel is projected on a plane including the strike object and a field observation point, and then it is converted into the straight vertical channel right above the strike object. Thus, the height-dependent lightning-current propagation speed along the equivalent channel depends on the direction of the observation point. The proposed method greatly reduces computational resources required for calculating LEMPs without deteriorating accuracy since it allows the use of the 2-D FDTD method. LEMP waveforms measured at a horizontal distance of 27, 57, and 101 km (in different directions) from the strike object are accurately reproduced by the proposed method. The results clarified that the lower region of the tortuous lightning has a large influence on the wavefront of the LEMPs at a horizontal distance ranging from 20 to 100 km from the strike point.",0,CHEAT
"In Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds, remote users access provided virtual machines (VMs) via the management server. The management server is managed by cloud operators, but not all the cloud operators are trusted in semi-trusted clouds. They can execute arbitrary management commands to users' VMs and redirect users' commands to malicious VMs, which is called the VM redirection attack. The root cause is that the binding of users to VMs is weak. In other words, it is difficult to enforce the execution of only users' management commands to their VMs. In this paper, we propose UVBond for strongly binding users to their VMs to solve this problem. UVBond boots user's VM by decrypting its encrypted disk inside the trusted hypervisor. Then it issues a VM descriptor to securely identify that VM. To bridge the semantic gap between high-level management commands and low-level hypercalls, UVBond uses hypercall automata, which accept the sequences of hypercalls issued by commands. We have implemented UVBond in Xen and confirmed that a VM descriptor and hypercall automata prevented attacks and that the overhead was not large.",0,CHEAT
"In the field of automatic target recognition and tracking, long-term tracking for aerial infrared target has been recently seen with great interest. Although deep trackers and correlation filtering trackers offer competitive results on performance, the problems of deformation, abrupt motion, heavy occlusion, and out of view still remain unsolved. In addition, since this paper focus on infrared images, it is also important to consider that infrared images have a significant drawbacks, such as low resolution, low contrast, and lack of textures. In this paper, we adopt correlation filtering trackers and deep learning detection method to achieve accurate tracking results. Our tracking system composed of three parts: the DTB correlation filtering tracker (DTB-CF), a better regression model to discriminate the target from the background with adjustable Gaussian window functions; the UTA correlation filtering tracker (UTA-CF), an optimum regression model to update the target appearance with simultaneously optimal in position, scale, and integration of multi-feature fusion; and the YOLOv3 re-detector, which ensures re-location of the correct position of the target when the tracking fails. In addition, we introduce the ratio between average peak-to-correlation energy (APCE) of the current frame and average APCE of former frames as a criterion to update the UTA-CF tracker to maintain the target model stability. And we combine the nearest neighbor maximum value method with APCE as criterion together to initialize the YOLOv3 re-detector. We evaluate our algorithm on real aerial infrared target thermal image sequences in terms of precision plot, success plot, and speed. The experimental results show that our method has a significant improvement than the state-of-the-art methods for long-term tracking both in accuracy and robustness for aerial infrared object tracking.",0,CHEAT
"Head detection plays an important role in localizing and identifying persons from visual data. Most existing methods treat head detection as a specific form of object detection. Head detection is nontrivial due to the considerable difficulty in building the local and global information under conditions of unconstrained pose and orientation. To address these issues, this paper presents an effective adaptive relational network to capture context information, which is greatly helpful to suppress missed detection. We show that the fundamental contextual properties, such as the global shape priors from different heads and the local adjacent relationship between the head and shoulders, can be systematically quantified by visual operators. Specifically, we propose a two-step search algorithm to quantify the global intergroup conflict with adaptive scale, pose and viewpoint. Meanwhile, a structured feature module is introduced to capture the local relation of intraindividual stability. Finally, the global priors and local relation are integrated seamlessly into a single-stage head detector that is end-to-end trainable.

"The hierarchical routing protocol in the wireless sensor network (WSN) is widely applied because of its good network stability and effective communication capability. As the earliest hierarchical routing protocol, Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy(LEACH) had low energy efficiency without considering the state of nodes. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient LEACH-based protocol to improve LEACH. The state of the cluster heads in the previous rounds, as well as residual energy and alive nodes density, are used as indicators to measure the current round cluster head selection. The modified protocol fixes the issue that the number of cluster heads dropped rapidly with dead nodes increase. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol can prolong the network lifetime of WSN effectively, and reduce the energy consumption with the balancing energy distribution.",0,CHEAT
"This work considers the estimation of the seismic events using a Bayesian filtering method, a multiple model particle filtering (MMPF) framework, in particular, from the noisy seismic records. According to the nonlinearity of the seismic signals, the nonlinear dynamical system can be used for the modelling of the signal. In geological studies, it is very important to accurately estimate the events from the recorded seismic signals, under noisy environment in particular since the signal is usually acquired usually under noisy conditions resulting in the difficulty in information extraction. This work proposes the MMPF, an effective filter in a sequential Monte Carlo method, in cooperated with the seismic wavelet model for the estimation of the seismic events under the noisy environments. To evaluate the performance of the method, a set of synthetic noisy signals with different numbers of events, noise levels, was created and used in the simulations. Results illustrates that the proposed MMPF can provide the excellent seismic event estimates under noisy environment.",0,CHEAT
"This paper presents a computationally efficient method for performance verification and tuning of model-based controllers in constrained nonlinear systems subject to probabilistic uncertainties with arbitrary distributions. The proposed method is based on an extension of generalized polynomial chaos, an asymptotically convergent spectral method for uncertainty propagation, to directly handle arbitrary uncertainty distributions. The proposed arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) method only requires knowledge of the statistical moments of the distribution, and is capable of estimating the aPC expansion coefficients using a minimal number of closed-loop simulations. Advantages of the proposed aPC method are demonstrated on a benchmark continuous reactor problem controlled by a scenario-based nonlinear model predictive controller.",0,CHEAT
"The widespread adoption of technology-enhanced learning in various knowledge disciplines has pushed forward the development of information technology-assisted media for language learning and teaching. However, most of the existing electronic-learning (e-learning) solutions have underexplored and under-addressed given specific characteristics of grammar learning, which is one of the most demanding areas of language education. The lack of pedagogically informed instructional design to enhance learning performance on the current system can result in low motivation and engagement due to an imbalance and excessive increase of the cognitive load. This paper attempts to address these deficiencies posed by the existing systems by proposing smart communication networks that are driven by the student learning experience to manage cognitive load in the context of grammar learning. The e-grammar learning networks serve as a collaborative learning platform that combines a pedagogically informed instructional model named attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) and cyber interaction among teaching/learning agents. From the technological perspective, our numerical simulations demonstrate the desirable performance indicators of the proposed networks to facilitate information exchange and learning. From the education perspective, our empirical studies show that the overall smart network-enabled e-grammar learning system has desirable characteristics to motivate learners (m = 3.78) and manage their overall cognitive load (m = 1.73), which suggest the promising capability of the proposed system.",0,CHEAT

"HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) is the state-of-the-art technology for improving the quality of user experience under conditions of time-varying available bandwidth. Developing the bitrate adaptation algorithm becomes more challenging with the transition to 4G cellular networks. The features of bandwidth variation caused by changes in radio channel quality are significantly different from the pattern caused by changes in radio channel resources. In this paper, we propose a bitrate adaptation algorithm for 4G cellular networks with bandwidth variation pattern differentiation. By investigating the bandwidth data profiles collected from an actual 4G cellular network with the field test approach, we distinguish the pattern of bandwidth capacity variations as sustained fluctuations and instantaneous hopping. With bandwidth variation pattern differentiation, the proposed algorithm performs a smoothed bitrate adaptation to sustained fluctuations and an instant bitrate adaptation to instantaneous hopping. Performance evaluations obtained on a 4G cellular network testbed demonstrate that the algorithm achieves reductions in bitrate switching frequency and playback stalls while increasing the average bitrate.",0,CHEAT

"Passwords form part of our daily routine and even though there are alternative authentication mechanisms, such as biometrics, passwords stubbornly persist. Passwords have been around for the last few decades, but also the various problems associated with users trying to create passwords that are strong and secure. Users are faced with a cognitive burden in managing passwords which often leads to poor password practices or users recycling passwords across various accounts. While there is no anticipated end to the use of passwords, scholars have identified that passwords need to be better supported - one such method is using a password manager. There is a wealth of technical research relating to password managers, which has led to drastic improvements and the maturing of the technology. However, there is a little research on why people would choose to adopt password managers. To explore these factors, this research uses an adapted version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) that includes trust as an additional construct. Using empirical data, the results of the study show that performance expectancy, habit, and trust are key factors in the intention to adopt a password manager.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper we describe a falls detection and classification algorithm for discriminating falls from daily life activities using a MEMS accelerometer. The algorithm is based on a shallow Neural Network with three hidden layers, used as fall/non fally classifier, trained with daily life activities features and fall features. The novelty of this algorithm is that synthetic falls are generated as multivariate random Gaussian features, so only real daily life features must be collected during some day of normal living. Moreover, the features related to synthetic fall events are generated as complement of normal features. First of all, the features acquired during daily life are clustered by Principal Component Analysis and no Fall activities shall be recorded. The complement set of the normal features is found and used as a mask for Monte Carlo generation of synthetic fall. The two feature sets, namely the features recorded from daily life activities and those artificially generated are used to train the Neural Network. This approach is suitable for a practical utilization of a Neural Network based fall detection characterized by high Recall-Precision rate.",0,CHEAT

"The large pose variations and misalignment errors exhibited by person images significantly increase the difficulty of person Re-Identification (ReID). Existing works commonly apply extra operations like pose estimation, part segmentation, etc., to alleviate those issues and improve the robustness of pedestrian representations. While boosting the ReID accuracy, those operations introduce considerable computational overheads and make the deep models complex and hard to tune. To chase a more efficient solution, we propose a Part-Guided Representation (PGR) composed of Pose Invariant Feature (PIF) and Local Descriptive Feature (LDF), respectively. We call PGR “Part-Guided” because it is trained and supervised by local part cues. Specifically, PIF approximates a pose invariant representation inferred by pose estimation and pose normalization. LDF focuses on discriminative body parts by approximating a representation learned with body region segmentation. In this way, extra pose extraction is only introduced during the training stage to supervise the learning of PGR, but is not required during the testing stage for feature extraction. Extensive comparisons with recent works on five widely used datasets demonstrate the competitive accuracy and efficiency of PGR.",0,CHEAT

"In GitHub, integrators inspect submitted code changes, make evaluation decision, and close pull requests. However, some pull requests may get reopened for further modification and code review. It is important to predict reopened pull requests immediately after pull requests' first close, and help integrators reopen pull requests in time. If pull requests are reopened a long time after their close, they may cause conflicts with newly submitted pull requests, add software maintenance cost, and increase burden for already busy developers. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first look at predicting reopened pull requests in GitHub. We propose an approach DTPre which is an automatic predictor of reopened pull requests based on Decision Tree classifier. DTPre mainly analyzes code features of modified changes, review features during evaluation, and developer feature of contributors. We evaluate the effectiveness of DTPre on 7 Open Source projects containing 100,622 pull requests. Experimental results show that DTPre has high performances by achieving a precision of 95.53%, recall of 99.01% and F1-measure of 97.23% on average.

"Identifying potential abuses of human rights through imagery is a novel and challenging task in the field of computer vision, which will enable to expose human rights violations over large-scale data that may otherwise be impossible. While standard databases for object and scene categorization contain hundreds of different classes, the largest available dataset of human rights violations contains only four classes. Here, we introduce the human rights archive (HRA) database, a verified-by-experts repository of 3050 human rights violations photographs, labeled with human rights semantic categories, comprising a list of the types of human rights abuses encountered at present. With the HRA dataset and a two-phase transfer learning scheme, we fine-tuned the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to provide human rights violations classification CNNs. We also present extensive experiments refined to evaluate how well object-centric and scene-centric CNN features can be combined for the task of recognizing human rights abuses. With this, we show that the HRA database poses a challenge at a higher level for the well-studied representation learning methods and provide a benchmark in the task of human rights violations recognition in visual context.

"This paper proposes a new framework for pulmonary nodule diagnosis using radiomic features extracted from a single computed tomography (CT) scan. The proposed framework integrates appearance and shape features to get a precise diagnosis for the extracted lung nodules. The appearance features are modeled using 3D Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and higher-order Markov Gibbs random field (MGRF) model because of their ability to describe the spatial non-uniformity in the texture of the nodule regardless of its size. The shape features are modeled using Spherical Harmonic expansion and some basic geometric features in order to have a full description of the shape complexity of the nodules. Finally, all the modeled features are fused and fed to a stacked autoencoder to differentiate between the malignant and benign nodules. Our framework is evaluated using 727 nodules which are selected from the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset, and achieved classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 93.12%, 92.47%, and 93.60% respectively.",0,CHEAT

To extract useful opinions from the sightseeing tweets, we define classes into which they are classified of them. These classified sightseeing tweets are used for analyzing opinions and polarities related to tourist spots and events. In addition, we propose a new model with convolutional neural networks to classify tweets. Distributed representation is one of the most well-known approaches to convert text data into numeric vectors so that text data can be input to neural networks.

"To determine the optimal trajectory for the dive phase of a hypersonic missile, a maneuver strategy using inverted flight is presented. The combat scene that the hypersonic missile attacks the fixed target on the ground is considered in this paper. Particularly, a maneuvering form named inverted flight is first applied to the hypersonic missiles. Afterward, an optimal trajectory is designed by minimizing the attack time with a preset terminal flight path angle, where the constraints of the angle of attack, dynamic pressure, heating transfer rate, and normal overload are taken into account. In order to solve the designed trajectory optimization problem, an improved hp-adaptive pseudospectral method with mesh size reduction is presented.

Furthermore, contrast simulation demonstrates that the inverted flight has better trajectory performance than normal flight.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, a new channel estimation algorithm is proposed that exploits channel sparsity in the time domain for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based underwater acoustical (UWA) communications systems in the presence of Rician fading. A path-based channel model is used, in which the channel is described by a limited number of paths, each characterized by a delay, Doppler scale, and attenuation factor. The resulting algorithm initially estimates the overall sparse channel tap delays and Doppler shifts using a compressed sensing approach, in the form of the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Then, a computationally efficient and novel channel estimation algorithm is developed by combining the OMP and maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) techniques for estimating the sparse complex channel path gains whose prior densities have complex Gaussian distributions with unknown mean and variance vectors, where a computationally efficient maximum likelihood algorithm is proposed for their estimation. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the mean square error and symbol error rate performances of the OMP-MAP algorithm uniformly outperforms the conventional OMP-based channel estimation algorithm, in case of uncoded OFDM-based UWA communications systems.",0,CHEAT
"The rapid growth in the adoption of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is motivated by the advantages offered with respect to wired systems, such as cost-effectiveness, easiness of installation, scalability, flexibility, and self-organization. However, due to their nature, the nodes in WSN rely on a limited energy source; therefore, an efficient communication among the nodes is desirable to prolong the lifetime of the WSN. In particular, the alternation of active and sleep states and the regulation of the transmission power represent two common approaches to save energy. This paper proposes the simultaneous use of two fuzzy logic controllers to dynamically adjust the sleeping time and the transmission power of the nodes in order to optimize energy consumption. The experimental results show a network lifetime improvement ranging from 30 to 40%, according to the adopted Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol.",0,CHEAT

Deep cooperative sensing (DCS), which constitutes the first CSS framework based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), is proposed. In DCS, instead of the explicit mathematical modeling of CSS, the strategy for combining the individual sensing results of the SUs is learned autonomously with a CNN using training sensing samples regardless of whether the individual sensing results are quantized or not. Moreover, both spectral and spatial correlation of individual sensing outcomes are taken into account such that an environment-specific CSS is enabled in DCS. Through simulations, we show that the performance of CSS can be greatly improved by the proposed DCS.",0,CHEAT

"Millimeter wave (MmWave) is a promising technology nowadays because it provides users with ultra-high data rate links with low latency time.

MmWave standard, IEEE 802.11 ad, proposed using scheduled medium access control (MAC) based on time division multiple access (TDMA) to share radio resources among active mmWave users. MmWave has a highly dynamic time-variant channel with high blocking probability which highly degrades the entire system performance.

"Small, low-cost, wireless cameras are becoming increasingly commonplace making surreptitious observation of people more difficult to detect. Previous work in detecting hidden cameras has only addressed limited environments in small spaces where the user has significant control of the environment. To address this problem in a less constrained scope of environments, we introduce the concept of similarity of simultaneous observation where the user utilizes a camera (Wi-Fi camera, camera on a mobile phone or laptop) to compare timing patterns of data transmitted by potentially hidden cameras and the timing patterns that are expected from the scene that the known camera is recording. To analyze the patterns, we applied several similarity measures and demonstrated an accuracy of over 87% and and F1 score of 0.88 using an efficient threshold-based classification. Furthermore, we used our data set to train a neural network and saw improved results with accuracy as high as 97% and an F1 score over 0.95 for both indoors and outdoors settings. From these results, we conclude that similarity of simultaneous observation is a feasible method for detecting hidden wireless cameras that are streaming video of a user. Our work removes significant limitations that have been put on previous detection methods.",0,CHEAT

"Health indicators (HI) attempt to identify and quantify history and ongoing degradation processes by extracting feature information from collected data. The main problems in the existing HI construction methods are as follows: (1) existing methods use fixed learning rate to train deep learning network, which is inefficient; (2) existing HIs construction methods do not take into account phase degradation; (3) failure threshold is difficult to determine in remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. In this paper, a HI construction method of rolling bearings based on a deep convolutional neural network with polynomial decaying learning rate (PDCNN) considering phase degradation is proposed. In this paper, the original vibration signal is input into the PDCNN, and the features extracted from the deep convolutional neural network are input into the deep neural network (DNN) to construct HI. The training label setting takes into account phase degradation. The polynomial decaying learning rate is used to train the neural network efficiently. Examples show that the HI constructed by the proposed method is superior to compared three methods in monotonicity and trendability. The polynomial decaying learning rate can improve the training efficiency of deep neural network and save a lot of time. The value of the constructed HI is in the interval [0, 1], which solves the problem that the failure threshold is difficult to determine in RUL prediction.",0,CHEAT
"This paper is about one way to address a troubling aspect of our use of software-intensive systems in complex environments: information flow across the system boundary. Everything we (and any other organism or embedded system) can know about the world around us is limited and largely determined by our sensor data, and what we can deduce or otherwise learn about the regularities they can be expected to exhibit. As system designers, we can program some of this knowledge into our systems, but we are almost always wrong in important and unforeseen ways. We need to help the systems we design mitigate these problems by actively participating in creating this knowledge. We want our systems to observe their environments, make critical inferences about their present and future behaviors, and use the resulting models to inform their own decisions. Moreover, we expect these systems to do the same analyses on their own internal structure and behavior, and on their interactions with the environment, to help them react more effectively to unexpected partial system failures and environmental surprises. In this paper, we show how the Wrappings integration infrastructure applies to this class of problems, by describing the architecture of self-modeling systems, which have models of their own behavior that are used to generate and manage that behavior.",0,CHEAT
"With the stringent demand of high data transmission, the scenario of the next generation network has changed drastically. Among various techniques of reducing the latency data of transmission and providing better quality-of-service, the deployment of ultra dense small cells is deemed as the most promising one which reduces the average distance from a mobile user to the nearest base station. However, the overhead of energy consumption introduced by the network densification needs to be carefully addressed using dynamic switching technique, in which underutilized base stations are put into lower power sleep mode. On the other hand, the new user association scheme needs to be developed to synergize well with novel techniques and improve energy efficiency further.

"Discrimination of food-contaminating microorganisms is an essential technology to secure the safety in manufacturing of foods and beverages. Conventionally, discrimination of the microorganisms has been performed by morphological observation, genetic analysis, and more recently, biochemical fingerprinting using mass spectrometry. However, several drawbacks exist in these methods, such as long assay time, cumbersome operations, and expensive equipment. To address these issues, we have proposed a novel method for discrimination of food-contaminating microorganisms, termed “colony fingerprinting”, based on bioimage informatics. In colony fingerprinting, growth of bacterial colonies were monitored using a lens-less imaging system. The characteristic images of colonies, referred to as colony fingerprints (CFPs), were obtained over time, and subsequently used to extract discriminative parameters. We demonstrated to discriminate 20 bacterial species by analyzing the extracted parameters with machine learning approaches, namely support vector machine and random forest. Colony fingerprinting is a promising method for rapid and easy discrimination of food-contaminating microorganisms.",0,CHEAT

"Although deep learning pathology diagnostic algorithms are proving comparable results with human experts in a wide variety of tasks, they still require a huge amount of well annotated data for training. Generating such extensive and well labelled datasets is time consuming and is not feasible for certain tasks and so, most of the medical datasets available are scarce in images and therefore, not enough for training. In this work we validate that the use of few shot learning techniques can transfer knowledge from a well defined source domain from Colon tissue into a more generic domain composed by Colon, Lung and Breast tissue by using very few training images. Our results show that our few-shot approach is able to obtain a balanced accuracy (BAC) of 90% with just 60 training images, even for the Lung and Breast tissues that were not present on the training set. This outperforms the finetune transfer learning approach that obtains 73% BAC with 60 images and requires 600 images to get up to 81% BAC.",0,CHEAT
"A joint communication and state estimation problem in a Gaussian multiple access channel with common additive state is considered. The state process is assumed to be IID Gaussian, and known non-causally at both the transmitters. The receiver not only has to decode the messages from the transmitters, but also needs to estimate the state process to within some prescribed squared error distortion. We provide a complete characterization of the optimal sum-rate versus distortion performance.",0,CHEAT
"It is envisaged that the future cellular networks (5G) will be able to meet the promising capacity and quality of experience requirements through extreme network densification and conglomeration of diverse technologies. It is easy to fathom that efficient management of such a convoluted network will be one of the big challenges faced by 5G. To cope with this challenge, Self-Organizing Networks (SONs) that were originally designed for legacy networks with reactive approach needs to be transformed to proactive paradigm. This radical transformation is possible only if the future network state can be predicted beforehand by harnessing historical network data. Mobility prediction is one of the key enablers of Proactive SON which enables efficient resource management. In this paper, we perform comparative analysis of four mobility predictors: Deep Neural Network (DNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting Trees (XGBoost), Semi-Markov, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our investigation is based on realistic synthetic dataset of eighty-four mobile users generated through realistic Self-similar Least Action Walk (SLAW) mobility model. We evaluate the effectiveness of each model not only based on the model's ability to predict the future location of mobile users but also the time each algorithm takes to be fully trained and perform such prediction. XGBoost stands out as clear winner among all predictors considered with high accuracy of 90%. Its high prediction accuracy enables high energy saving gain of above 80% when it is employed for driving proactive energy saving SON solution.",0,CHEAT
"Recently, latent vector embedding has become a research hotspot, with its great representative ability to measure the latent relationships among different views. However, most researches utilize the inner product of latent vectors as the representation of relationships, and they develop some embedding models based on this theory. In this paper, we take deep insight into the existing embedding models and find that utilizing the inner product may increase several problems: 1) in latent space, the inner product among three vectors may violate triangle principle; 2) the inner product cannot measure the relationships between vectors in the same category, such as user and user and item and item; and 3) the inner product cannot catch the collaborative relationships (user-user and item-item) for collaborative filtering. Along with this line, we propose a latent vector embedding model for collaborative filtering: latent dual metric embedding (LDME), which utilizes the dual-Euclidean distance in latent space, instead of the inner product, to represent different types of relationships (user-user, item-item, and user-item) with a uniform framework. Specifically, we design an embedding loss function in LDME, which can measure the close and remote relationships between entities, tackle the above problems, and achieve a more clear, well-explained embedding result. Extensive experiments are conducted on several real-world datasets (Amazon, Yelp, Taobao, and Jingdong), where the expiring results demonstrate that LDME can overperform some state-of-the-art user-item embedding models and can benefit the existing collaborative filtering models.",0,CHEAT

"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is in the midst of defining and developing the future space and ground architecture for the coming decades to return science and exploration discovery data back to investigators on Earth. Optimizing the data return from these missions requires planning, design, standards, and operations coordinated from formulation and development throughout the mission. The use of automation enhanced by cognition and machine learning are potential methods for optimizing data return, reducing costs of operations, and helping manage the complexity of the automated systems. In this article, we discuss the potential role of machine learning in the linkto- link aspect of the communication systems. An experiment using NASA's Space Communication and Navigation Testbed onboard the International Space Station and the ground station located at NASA John H. Glenn Research Center demonstrates for the first time the benefits and challenges of applying machine learning to space links in the actual flight environment.

"In this paper, we study the problem of distributed multi-agent optimization over a network, where each agent possesses a local cost function that is smooth and strongly convex. The global objective is to find a common solution that minimizes the average of all cost functions. Assuming agents only have access to unbiased estimates of the gradients of their local cost functions, we consider a distributed stochastic gradient tracking method. We show that, in expectation, the iterates generated by each agent are attracted to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, where they accumulate exponentially fast (under a constant step size choice). More importantly, the limiting (expected) error bounds on the distance of the iterates from the optimal solution decrease with the network size, which is a comparable performance to a centralized stochastic gradient algorithm. Numerical examples further demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.",0,CHEAT
"With the explosive growth of multimedia applications, heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets) are widely deployed to meet the increasingly impressing demands on communication capacity. However, supporting the massive real-time traffic generated by always-on multimedia applications in HetNets causes enormous energy consumptions. The tradeoff between energy consumptions and profits of service providers while maintaining satisfied quality-of-service (QoS) has become a significant objective. To this end, this paper proposes a novel framework of power rationing in HetNets to achieve maximal profit and guaranteed service performance. A dynamic power rationing strategy that employs Tullock contest is developed to model the power control of multiple cells into a game and solve the contradiction of profits and energy consumption as the tradeoff between QoS and cost. Two principal challenges in gaming, incomplete information, and the curse of dimensionality are resolved by the designed virtual repeated game that adopts the Monte-Carlo method and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain the Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium of power rationing balances the energy consumptions and profits of cells, which ensures the optimal solution for the multimedia service providers and HetNets operators. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed model can serve as an efficient tool for power rationing in multimedia HetNets.",0,CHEAT
"The aim of this paper is to evaluate the distribution system reliability including weather dependency of component failure rate (FR) and restoration time (RT) while an efficient Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method is used. The effects of different weather conditions such as high winds, lightning can be incorporated in the reliability evaluation by considering their impacts on FT and RT. MLMC method is a recently developed variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) which is proposed for reducing reliability indices computation time. Application of the MLMC method is carried out on a well-known test distribution system. The effects of the normal and adverse weather conditions on reliability estimation are determined. The results are compared with those obtained by using MCS.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, we consider resource allocation for edge computing in internet of things (IoT) networks. Specifically, each end device is considered as an agent, which makes its decisions on whether offloading the computation tasks to the edge devices or not. To minimize the long-term weighted sum cost which includes the power consumption and the task execution latency, we consider the channel conditions between the end devices and the gateway, the computation task queue as well as the remaining computation resource of the end devices as the network states. The problem of making a series of decisions at the end devices is modelled as a Markov decision process and solved by the reinforcement learning approach. Therefore, we propose a near optimal task offloading algorithm based on ϵ-greedy Q-learning. Simulations validate the feasibility of our proposed algorithm, which achieves a better trade-off between the power consumption and the task execution latency compared to these of edge computing and local computing modes.",0,CHEAT
"Multicast is widely deployed in data centers for point-to-multi-point communications. It has an established set of control protocols such as IGMP and PIM that has limitations around the lack of bandwidth awareness when establishing the multicast trees. This could lead to over-subscription of network links and packet loss impacting user quality of experience. Other existing multicast issues are related to path setup time as delay translates to deterioration of user experience. In this paper, we present and implement the DiRP algorithm utilizing distributed decision making architecture to optimize multicast tree formation while maintaining low path setup time. The system is implemented using off-the-shelve commercially available switches. the proposed DiRP algorithm maintains the creation and removal of source trees based on bandwidth requirements. We test the algorithm using Cisco's Nexus commercially available switches. Testing results confirm that the DiRP Algorithm is able to setup multicast tree paths based on available bandwidth while maintaining distributed decision making in the fabric to lower path setup time. The system offers substantially lower path setup time compared to centralized systems while maintaining bandwidth awareness when setting up the fabric.",0,CHEAT
"Ensuring protection against side channel attacks (SCAs) is a crucial requirement in the design of modern secure embedded systems. Profiled SCAs, the class to which template attacks and machine learning attacks belong, derive a model of the side channel behavior of a device identical to the target one, and exploit the said model to extract the key from the target, under the hypothesis that the side channel behaviors of the two devices match. We propose an architectural countermeasure against cross-device profiled attacks which differentiates the side channel behavior of different instances of the same hardware design, preventing the reuse of a model derived on a device other than the target one. In particular, we describe an instance of our solution providing a protected hardware implementation of the advanced encryption standard (AES) block cipher and experimentally validate its resistance against both Bayesian templates and machine learning approaches based on support vector machines also considering different state-of-the-art feature reduction techniques to increase the effectiveness of the profiled attacks. Results show that our countermeasure foils the key retrieval attempts via profiled attacks ensuring a key derivation accuracy equivalent to a random guess.",0,CHEAT
"We introduce a game-theoretic framework to explore revenue sharing in an Edge-Cloud computing system, in which computing service providers at the edge of the Internet (edge providers) and computing service providers at the cloud (cloud providers) collectively provide computing resources to clients (e.g., end users or applications) at the edge. Different from traditional cloud computing, the providers in an Edge-Cloud system are independent and self-interested. To achieve high system-level efficiency, the manager of the system adopts a task distribution mechanism to maximize the total revenue received from clients and also adopts a revenue sharing mechanism to split the received revenue among computing servers (and hence service providers). Under those system-level mechanisms, service providers attempt to game with the system in order to maximize their own utilities, by strategically allocating their resources (e.g., computing servers). Our framework models the competition among the providers in an Edge-Cloud system as a non-cooperative game. We have shown the existence of Nash equilibrium in the game both theoretically and practically through simulations and experiments on an emulation system that we have developed. We find that revenue sharing mechanisms have a significant impact on the system-level efficiency at Nash equilibria, and surprisingly the revenue sharing mechanism based directly on actual contributions can result in significantly worse system performance than Shapley value sharing mechanism and Ortmann proportional sharing mechanism. Our framework provides an effective economics approach to the understanding and designing of efficient Edge-Cloud computing systems.",0,CHEAT
"The current discrete-time (e.g., hourly) modeling and prediction methods fall short in capturing and anticipating the sub-interval variations of electricity load. This leads to inability of power system operators to appropriately utilize the available resources to follow and compensate the load variations. This paper takes a novel and different approach on modeling electricity load, and proposes a continuous-time model for characterizing the uncertainty and variability of load. More specifically, the electricity load is modeled as a continuous-time stochastic process that is projected on a reduced-order function space spanned by Bernstein polynomials, which ensures the continuity of the process over the estimation and forecasting horizons. We assume a Gaussian process (GP) prior on the load process and design a covariance function that reflects the periodicity and smoothness of electricity load. We develop a computationally efficient method for estimating the hyperparameters of the model using the solution of a maximum likelihood estimation problem and form the posterior GP process. The proposed method is utilized to model and predict the load of California Independent System Operator (CAISO). The proposed model uniquely predicts the continuous-time mean value and uncertainty envelopes of future CAISO load, which inherently embeds information on the continuous-time variations and the associated ramping requirements of the load.",0,CHEAT
"This paper develops an approach for household appliance identification and classification of household activities of daily living (ADLs) using residential smart meter data.

This paper presents a deep learning approach based on multilayer, feedforward neural networks that can identify common household electrical appliances from a typical household smart meter measurement. The performance of this approach is tested and validated using publicly available smart meter data sets. The identified appliances are then mapped to household activities, or ADLs. The resulting ADL classifier can provide insights into the behavior of the household occupants, which has a number of applications in the energy domain and in other fields.",0,CHEAT

"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in future wireless networks is gaining attention due to their quick deployment without requiring the existing infrastructure. Earlier studies on UAV-aided communication consider generic scenarios, and very few studies exist on the evaluation of UAV-aided communication in practical networks. The existing studies also have several limitations, and hence, an extensive evaluation of the benefits of UAV communication in practical networks is needed. In this paper, we proposed a UAV-aided Wi-Fi Direct network architecture. In the proposed architecture, a UAV equipped with a Wi-Fi Direct group owner (GO) device, the so-called Soft-AP, is deployed in the network to serve a set of Wi-Fi stations. We propose to use a simpler yet efficient algorithm for the optimal placement of the UAV. The proposed algorithm dynamically places the UAV in the network to reduce the distance between the GO and client devices. The expected benefits of the proposed scheme are to maintain the connectivity of client devices to increase the overall network throughput and to improve energy efficiency. As a proof of concept, realistic simulations are performed in the NS-3 network simulator to validate the claimed benefits of the proposed scheme. The simulation results report major improvements of 23% in client association, 54% in network throughput, and 33% in energy consumption using single UAV relative to the case of stationary or randomly moving GO. Further improvements are achieved by increasing the number of UAVs in the network. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work exists on the evaluation of the UAV-aided Wi-Fi Direct networks.",0,CHEAT

"The challenge of running complex physics code on the largest computers available has led to dataflow paradigms being explored. While such approaches are often applied at smaller scales, the challenge of extreme-scale data flow computing remains. The Uintah dataflow framework has consistently used dataflow computing at the largest scales on complex physics applications. At present Uintah contains two main dataflow models. Both are based upon asynchronous communication. One uses a static graph-based approach with asynchronous communication and the other uses a more dynamic approach that was introduced almost a decade ago. Subsequent changes within the Uintah runtime system combined with many more large scale experiments, has necessitated a reevaluation of these two approaches, comparing them in the context of large scale problems. While the static approach has worked well for some large-scale simulations, the dynamic approach is seen to offer performance improvements over the static case for a challenging fluid-structure interaction problem at large scale that involves fluid flow and a moving solid represented using particle method on an adaptive mesh.",0,CHEAT

"There is an increasing interest to identify users and behaviour profiling from network traffic metadata for traffic engineering and security monitoring. Network security administrators and internet service providers need to create the user behaviour traffic profile to make an informed decision about policing, traffic management, and investigate the different network security perspectives. Additionally, the analysis of network traffic metadata and extraction of feature sets to understand trends in application usage can be significant in terms of identifying and profiling the user by representing the user's activity. However, user identification and behaviour profiling in real-time network management remains a challenge, as the behaviour and underline interaction of network applications are permanently changing. In parallel, user behaviour is also changing and adapting, as the online interaction environment changes. Also, the challenge is how to adequately describe the user activity among generic network traffic in terms of identifying the user and his changing behaviour over time. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for user identification and behaviour profiling and analysing individual usage per application. The research considered the application-level flow sessions identified based on Domain Name System filtering criteria and timing resolution bins (24-hour timing bins) leading to an extended set of features. Validation of the module was conducted by collecting Net Flow records for a 60 days from 23 users. A gradient boosting supervised machine learning algorithm was leveraged for modelling user identification based upon the selected features. The proposed method yields an accuracy for identifying a user based on the proposed features up to 74%.",0,CHEAT

"Algebraic thinking is a very important skill that should be mastered by students at an early stage before learning algebra. However, algebraic thinking is not emphasized in learning algebra. The traditional approach for teaching algebra, which involved writing and solving equations according to the rules of mathematics, is taught procedurally and in isolation from other mathematical domains, hence towards real-world application of learning mathematics. In this paper, we conducted a study that integrated the students' algebraic thinking into the problem-based learning (PBL) process. Qualitative data from a learning task, namely which consisted of teaching notes, self-readings, reflections, self-evaluations, evaluation of scenario problems, task-based interview transcripts, and task-based interview notes were used to explore the acquisition of algebraic thinking. Accordingly, the framework that integrates students' algebraic thinking with the PBL process is expected to assist teachers in enhancing the effectiveness of teaching and learning of algebra and can potentially serve as a basis for developing algebraic thinking among school students, particularly at lower secondary level.",0,CHEAT
"Inter-subject variabilities in brain signals can significantly deteriorate the accuracy of brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Every subject has different brain signals; also, the performance of a subject varies widely between sessions, within a session, between on-line and off-line settings, and even from epoch to epoch. Such variabilities arise in measurements obtained during different BCI sessions require subject and session specific decoder models. This work proposes three different deep learning models for subject-independent decoding of event-related potentials in electroencephalographic signals: (1) shallow convolutional neural network, (2) gated recurrent neural network, and (3) CNN-RNN-Net: a hybrid one-dimensional convolution and a gated recurrent unit model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models outperform the conventional baseline models in decoding subject-independent data.

"Long Short-Term Memory is a recurrent neural network that can be trained to remember long sequences of data and acts as a generative model. As a generative model, Long Short-Term Memory has the ability to reproduce the trained sequences for arbitrary length. We train Long Short-Term Memory with sequential motion data of Remo Dance, a traditional dance from East Java. Motion data is acquired from a motion capture system from real dancer as sequences of bone rotation. Training sequential data on Long Short-Term Memory is time consuming even by using current GPU technology. We found that applying feature scaling and how data are grouped to be trained together are useful strategies to achieve optimal training. Our experiments show that the scale factor in feature scaling depends on how many sequences are trained together. Single sequence trainings need value range from -8 to +8. Multiple sequences need a lower value range accordingly. We also found that sequences with small variances can be trained better when combined with large variances sequences. Trained Long Short-Term Memory is able to reproduce the dance moves with some variations.",0,CHEAT
"Deep learning (DL) algorithms have substantially improved in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are now able to outperform traditional algorithms in computer vision tasks such as object classification, detection, recognition, and image segmentation.

"How to reduce the content placement cost of cloud content delivery networks (CCDNs) is a hot topic in recent years. Traditional content placement methods mainly reduce the cost of content placement by constructing delivery trees, but they cannot adapt to the dynamic deployment of cloud proxy servers in the CCDNs. In addition, the traditional content placement method only provides delivery paths according to local decision-making without considering global dynamics of the congestion in the CCDNs, which is also one of the main factors causing high cost of content placement. To solve these problems, we propose a content placement model based on Q-learning for the dynamic CCDNs, called Q-content placement model (Q-CPM). This Q-learning approach can lead to better routing decisions due to up-to-date and more reliable congestion values. Then, based on the Q-CPM model, an algorithm is proposed to construct the Q-adaptive delivery tree (Q-ADT). In this algorithm, local and nonlocal congestion information is propagated over network learning packets. Through this algorithm, the paths with low congestion cost will be selected and can adapt to the dynamic cloud delivery environment. The experimental results show that the method can adapt to the dynamic changes of the CCDNs flexibly and reduce the overall congestion cost of content placement effectively.",0,CHEAT

"Opinion maximization in social networks is an optimization problem, which targets at determining some influential individuals (i.e., seed nodes), propagating the desired opinion to their neighbors, and eventually obtaining maximum opinion spread. Previous studies assume that influence power of one individual is mainly calculated by using some network structure properties and once the opinion of one individual is determined, its opinion usually keeps unchanged. However, in the real scenario, the influence power of one individual may be unknown and should be closely associated with the dynamic opinion formation process. In this paper, we propose a novel Influence Power-based Opinion Framework (IPOF) to solve the opinion maximization problem, which is composed of two phases: 1) influence power estimation, and 2) elimination of influence overlapping (EIO). Specifically, we design the exponential influence power and estimate the unknown parameter of influence power through maximum likelihood estimation due to its simplicity, practicability, and superior convergence in large samples. To generate the opinion series dynamically, the weighted voter model is proposed by leveraging influence power and intimate degree. Moreover, we also prove that the likelihood function is concave by using Hessian matrix. To determine the initial seed nodes and facilitate large opinion propagation, influence power-based EIO algorithm is proposed. Experimental results in six social networks demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmarks.",0,CHEAT

"This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for control of a quarter car semi-active suspension system based on reachable sets approach. The proposed approach provides the flexibility of systematically including the information on the bounds of future road disturbances over the prediction horizon onto the MPC problem formulation by means of reachable sets. This inclusion of future bounds into control design leverages the efficiency of the operation of suspension system.

"The operation of the electric grid in systems with a large hydroelectric component is often cast as a dynamic programming problem, in which state variables are reservoir levels. To avoid the curse of dimensionality in discretizing such states, the SDDP technique has been successfully applied. However, new demands are being placed on the optimization, with the penetration of renewable sources of faster variability, and the possible incorporation of shorter term energy storage.In this paper, we present preliminary work on extending the SDDP framework to such two time-scale problems. We apply the method to a stylized model of the Uruguayan system, relying on new open source implementations of SDDP to carry out the computations. Our results indicate that the method remains tractable despite the increased problem dimension.",0,CHEAT

"In this paper, when the stress and strength are two independent Kumaraswamy random variables, we derive the point and interval estimate of the stress-strength parameter, from both frequentist and Bayesian viewpoints, under the Type-II hybrid progressive censoring scheme. In fact, the problem is solved in two cases. First, with the assumption that the stress and strength have different first shape parameters and the common second shape parameter, we attain maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), approximation MLE, and two Bayesian approximation estimates, Lindley's approximation and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, due to lack of closed forms. Also, the asymptotic confidence interval of R is constructed by asymptotic distribution of it. Moreover, by using the MCMC method, we achieve the highest posterior density credible intervals. Second, with the assumption that the common shape parameter is known, we attain the MLE, the exact Bayes estimate, and the uniformly minimum-variance unbiased estimate of R. Also, we construct the asymptotic and Bayesian intervals for the stress-strength parameter. Furthermore, to compare the performance of various methods, we apply the Monte Carlo simulation.

"Robotic exoskeletons have emerged as effective rehabilitation and ability-enhancement tools, by mimicking or supporting natural body movements. The control schemes of exoskeletons are conventionally developed based on fixed torque-ankle state relationship or various human models, which are often lack of flexibility and adaptability to accurately address personalized movement assistance needs. This paper presents an adaptive control strategy for personalized robotic ankle exoskeleton in an effort to address this limitation. The adaptation was implemented by applying the experience-based fuzzy rule interpolation approach with the support of a muscle-tendon complex model. In particular, this control system is initialized based on the most common requirements of a “standard human model,” which is then evolved during its performance by effectively using the feedback collected from the wearer to support different body shapes and assistance needs. The experimental results based on different human models with various support demands demonstrate the power of the proposed control system in improving the adaptability, and thus applicability, of robotic ankle exoskeletons.",0,CHEAT
"Distribution networks are important components of power and energy infrastructure. Today's distribution networks are vulnerable to different types of faults. To make the electric grid more resilient, it is important to detect and locate faults in distribution lines quickly and accurately. Impedance methods are the most common ways used to locate the faults. In this paper, first possible fault locations are identified using the improved impedance method. Then, its natural frequencies are determined. Since there are more than one possible fault locations, it is necessary to identify the fault section in order to determine the fault location accurately. The fault section and its main location are determined through simulating the fault in each section of possible locations. This is done by small steps and through accommodating the determined frequency to the existing natural frequency registered in the original fault voltage form. The proposed method is applied in Salim's 11-node network in which effect of fault inception angles, effect of different resistors and fault type are tested. Accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method has been verified.",0,CHEAT

"We introduce a framework for dynamic evaluation of the fingers movements: flexion, extension, abduction and adduction. This framework estimates angle measurements from joints computed by a hand pose estimation algorithm using a depth sensor (Realsense SR300). Given depth maps as input, our framework uses Pose-REN [1], which is a state-of-art hand pose estimation method that estimates 3D hand joint positions using a deep convolutional neural network. The pose estimation algorithm runs in real-time, allowing users to visualise 3D skeleton tracking results at the same time as the depth images are acquired. Once 3D joint poses are obtained, our framework estimates a plane containing the wrist and MCP joints and measures flexion/extension and abduction/adduction angles by applying computational geometry operations with respect to this plane. We analysed flexion and abduction movement patterns using real data, extracting the movement trajectories. Our preliminary results show this method allows an automatic discrimination of hands with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and healthy patients. The angle between joints can be used as an indicative of current movement capabilities and function. Although the measurements can be noisy and less accurate than those obtained statically through goniometry, the acquisition is much easier, non-invasive and patient-friendly, which shows the potential of our approach. The system can be used with and without orthosis. Our framework allows the acquisition of measurements with minimal intervention and significantly reduces the evaluation time.",0,CHEAT
"Recently, 3D action recognition has received more attention of research and industrial communities thanks to the popularity of depth sensors and the efficiency of skeleton estimation algorithms. Accordingly, a large number of methods have been studied by using either handcrafted features with traditional classifiers or recurrent neural networks. However, they cannot learn high-level spatial and temporal features of a whole skeleton sequence exhaustively. In this paper, we proposed a novel encoding technique to transform the pose features of joint-joint distance and joint-joint orientation to color pixels. By concatenating the features of all frames in a sequence, the spatial joint correlations and temporal pose dynamics of action appearance are depicted by a color image. For learning action models, we adopt the strategy of end-to-end fine-tuning a pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks to completely capture multiple high-level features at multi-scale action representation. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D, the largest and most challenging 3D action recognition dataset, for both the cross-subject and cross-view evaluation protocols.",0,CHEAT

"It is critical to obtain stability certificate before deploying reinforcement learning in real-world mission-critical systems. This study justifies the intuition that smoothness (i.e., small changes in inputs lead to small changes in outputs) is an important property for stability-certified reinforcement learning from a control-theoretic perspective. The smoothness margin can be obtained by solving a feasibility problem based on semi-definite programming for both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, and it does not need to access the exact parameters of the learned controllers. Numerical evaluation on nonlinear and decentralized frequency control for large-scale power grids demonstrates that the smoothness margin can certify stability during both exploration and deployment for (deep) neural-network policies, which substantially surpass nominal controllers in performance. The study opens up new opportunities for robust Lipschitz continuous policy learning.",0,CHEAT
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have useful applications in machine learning tasks involving recognition and pattern analysis. Despite the favorable applications of DNNs, these systems can be exploited by adversarial examples. An adversarial example, which is created by adding a small amount of noise to an original sample, can cause misclassification by the DNN. Under specific circumstances, it may be necessary to create a selective untargeted adversarial example that will not be classified as certain avoided classes. Such is the case, for example, if a modified tank cover can cause misclassification by a DNN, but the bandit equipped with the DNN must misclassify the modified tank as a class other than certain avoided classes, such as a tank, armored vehicle, or self-propelled gun. That is, selective untargeted adversarial examples are needed that will not be perceived as certain classes, such as tanks, armored vehicles, or self-propelled guns. In this study, we propose a selective untargeted adversarial example that exhibits 100% attack success with minimum distortions. The proposed scheme creates a selective untargeted adversarial example that will not be classified as certain avoided classes while minimizing distortions in the original sample. To generate untargeted adversarial examples, a transformation is performed to minimize the probability of certain avoided classes and distortions in the original sample. As experimental datasets, we used MNIST and CIFAR-10, including the Tensorflow library. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme creates a selective untargeted adversarial example that exhibits 100% attack success with minimum distortions (1.325 and 34.762 for MNIST and CIFAR-10, respectively).",0,CHEAT

"In this paper, we propose a novel inverse tone mapping network, called “iTM-Net.” For training iTM-Net, we also propose a novel loss function that considers the non-linear relation between low dynamic range (LDR) and high dynamic range (HDR) images. For inverse tone mapping with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we first point out that training CNNs with a standard loss function causes a problem due to the non-linear relation between the LDR and HDR images. To overcome the problem, the novel loss function non-linearly tone-maps target HDR images into LDR ones on the basis of a tone mapping operator, and the distance between the tone-mapped images and predicted ones are then calculated. The proposed loss function enables us not only to normalize the HDR images but also to reduce the non-linear relation between LDR and HDR ones. The experimental results show that the HDR images predicted by the proposed iTM-Net have higher-quality than the HDR ones predicted by conventional inverse tone mapping methods, including the state of the art, in terms of both HDR-VDP-2.2 and PU encoding + MS-SSIM.

"Information in the form of text can be found in abundance in the web today, which can be mined to solve multifarious problems. Customer reviews, for instance, flow in across multiple sources in thousands per day which can be leveraged to obtain several insights. Our goal is to extract cases of a rare event e.g., recall of products, allegations of ethics or, legal concerns or, threats to product-safety, etc. from this enormous amount of data. Manual identification of such cases to be reported is extremely labour-intensive as well as time-sensitive, but failure to do so can have fatal impact on the industry's overall health and dependability; missing out on even a single case may lead to huge penalties in terms of customer experience, product liability and industry reputation.

"It is crucial to implement an effective and accurate fault diagnosis of a gearbox for mechanical systems. However, being composed of many mechanical parts, a gearbox has a variety of failure modes resulting in the difficulty of accurate fault diagnosis. Moreover, it is easy to obtain raw vibration signals from real gearbox applications, but it requires significant costs to label them, especially for multi-fault modes. These issues challenge the traditional supervised learning methods of fault diagnosis. To solve these problems, we develop an active learning strategy based on uncertainty and complexity. Therefore, a new diagnostic method for a gearbox is proposed based on the present active learning, empirical mode decomposition-singular value decomposition (EMD-SVD) and random forests (RF). First, the EMD-SVD is used to obtain feature vectors from raw signals. Second, the proposed active learning scheme selects the most valuable unlabeled samples, which are then labeled and added to the training data set. Finally, the RF, trained by the new training data, is employed to recognize the fault modes of a gearbox.

"A natural basis for the detection of a wireless random reactive jammer (RRJ) is the perceived violation by the detector [typically located at the access point (AP)] of the carrier sensing protocol underpinning many wireless random access protocols (e.g., Wi-Fi). Specifically, when the wireless medium is perceived by a station to be busy, a carrier sensing compliant station will avoid transmission, while an RRJ station will often initiate transmission. However, hidden terminals (HTs), i.e., activity detected by the AP but not by the sensing station, complicate the use of carrier sensing as the basis for RRJ detection since they provide plausible deniability to a station suspected of being an RRJ. The RRJ has the dual objectives of avoiding detection and effectively disrupting communication, but there is an inherent performance tradeoff between these two objectives. In this paper, we capture the behavior of both the RRJ and the compliant stations via a parsimonious Markov chain model and pose the detection problem using the framework of the Markov chain hypothesis testing. Our analysis yields the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the detector and the optimized behavior of the RRJ. While there has been extensive work in the literature on jamming detection, our innovation lies in leveraging carrier sensing as a natural and effective basis for detection.",0,CHEAT
"The Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) are often visible to the exposed terminal problem and hidden terminal problem, which exist due to non-transitivity in media access control schemes. This affects the utilization of channel and throughput in media access control protocols, e.g., dual busy tone multiple access protocol (DBTMA). Hence, to improve the fairness and throughput performance of the DBTMA it is very necessary to address the problems associated with hidden and exposed terminals. Hence, in this paper, the quality of service (QoS) is improved by enhancing the capability of the DBTMA for better network service in the MANETs. The proposed method uses an improved DBTMA called Retransmission Dual Busy Tone Multiple Access (RDBTMA) protocol. This is based on two elements namely: busy tones and Ready To Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) dialogues. In addition to this fast retransmission, a strategy is used further to improve its effectiveness. The retransmission strategy is adopted using negative acknowledgment after the collision occurred by the hidden nodes. A hidden node, where the collision occurs at access point, listens to the NACK signal and uses the signal to determine the requirement fast retransmission scheme. The proposed method is simulated and compared against existing methods in terms of various network parameters. The results show that the proposed RDBTMA protocol is effective in terms of the improved QoS in terms of network throughput (21.9%), packet delivery ratio (17.8%), 14.9% less packet loss, and 38% less route discovery delay than the existing methods.",0,CHEAT
"The ever-growing proliferation of mobile devices equipped with accelerometers has provided new opportunities to capture the semantic meanings of human activities and improve user experience with behavior-based recommendations, which heavily rely on the accuracy of the recognition of daily human activities. Acceleration-based human activity recognition (HAR) is a challenging problem because each accelerometer records multi-dimensional signals in both spatial and temporal domains that have different attributes for representing different activities or even the same activity. Thus we cannot directly compare these signals with each other, because they are embedded in a non-metric space. In this paper, we present a Personalized Recurrent Neural Network (PerRNN) to dynamically segment and recognize the human activities based on accelerometer data. Enlightened by the idea of spatiotemporal predictive learning, the proposed architecture is capable of memorizing different acceleration signals' appearances and temporal variations in a unified memory pool. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on a commonly used dataset, WISDM. Experiment results show that compared with state-of-the-art schemes, our proposed PerRNN system recognizes 6 different human activities with the highest overall accuracy of 96.44%.",0,CHEAT
"The identification of individual household appliances in the residential power grid can provide better consumption control and detection of anomalies present in some of these appliances. This identification is only possible if each electric appliance has an Electric Load Signature (ELS). The generation of ELS occurs through the Internet of Things (IoT) equipment, such as Smart Meter (SM) or Smart Plugs (SPs), which provides information necessary for this purpose. The proposed work allows the reading and detection of residential household appliances in the network, through the individual ELS of each load, using SPs together with the Machine Learning Algorithm. Some important electrical parameters will be analyzed and detected individually. With the aid of the Decision Tree and Naive Bayes algorithms, the creation data of each ELS is stored in a centralized database present in the Home Energy Management System and trained so that the identification in each SP is possible. A visual application is provided to the consumer at the HEM to be able to see which appliances are operating, consumption history, as well as anomalies and unwanted changes, present in the residential network.",0,CHEAT

"Objective: Deep learning has recently been applied to electrical impedance tomography (EIT) imaging. Nevertheless, there are still many challenges that this approach has to face, e.g., targets with sharp corners or edges cannot be well recovered when using circular inclusion training data. This paper proposes an iterative-based inversion method and a convolutional neural network (CNN) based inversion method to recover some challenging inclusions such as triangular, rectangular, or lung shapes, where the CNN-based method uses only random circle or ellipse training data. Methods: First, the iterative method, i.e., bases-expansion subspace optimization method (BE-SOM), is proposed based on a concept of induced contrast current (ICC) with total variation regularization. Second, the theoretical analysis of BE-SOM and the physical concepts introduced there motivate us to propose a dominant-current deep learning scheme for EIT imaging, in which dominant parts of ICC are utilized to generate multi-channel inputs of CNN. Results: The proposed methods are tested with both numerical and experimental data, where several realistic phantoms including simulated pneumothorax and pleural effusion pathologies are also considered. Conclusions and Significance: Significant performance improvements of the proposed methods are shown in reconstructing targets with sharp corners or edges. It is also demonstrated that the proposed methods are capable of fast, stable, and high-quality EIT imaging, which is promising in providing quantitative images for potential clinical applications.",0,CHEAT

"Honeypots have become an important tool for capturing attacks. Hybrid honeypots, including the front end and the back end, are widely used in research because of the scalability of the front end and the high interactivity of the back end. However, traditional hybrid honeypots have some problems that the flow control is difficult and topology simulation is not realistic. This paper proposes a new architecture based on SDN applied to the hybrid honeypot system for network topology simulation and attack traffic migration. Our system uses the good expansibility and controllability of the SDN controller to simulate a large and realistic network to attract attackers and redirect high-level attacks to a high-interaction honeypot for attack capture and further analysis. It improves the deficiencies in the network spoofing technology and flow control technology in the traditional honeynet. Finally, we set up the experimental environment on the mininet and verified the mechanism. The test results show that the system is more intelligent and the traffic migration is more stealthy.",0,CHEAT
"Edge detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision community. In this paper, we propose a novel concept for edge detection called Structural Edge. The Structural edges include occluding contours of objects as well as orientation discontinuities in surfaces that define the 3D structure of objects and their environments. This contrasts the semantic edge which is only the boundary between semantic areas. While existing edge detection methods focus on either semantic boundaries or low-level gradients, we focus on the structural edge. To achieve that, in this paper, we propose the structural edge dataset along with a benchmark. The structural edge dataset contains 600 images of natural indoor and outdoor scenes. The structural edges are labeled manually and validated by eye-tracking data from 10 participants with overall 20 trials. Later, we use the dataset to benchmark the existing edge detection methods. We benchmark both the learning based and non-learning based methods and draw the conclusion that existing methods cannot fully solve the structural edge detection. We encourage new research to exploit the proposed task.",0,CHEAT
This paper considers the transceiver design for uplink massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems with channel sparsity. Recent progress has shown that sparsity learning-based blind signal detection is able to retrieve the channel and data by using message passing based noisy matrix factorization. We propose a semi-blind signal detection scheme in which a short pilot sequence is introduced to each user packet and the knowledge of pilots is integrated into the message passing algorithm for noisy matrix factorization. We show that our semi-blind signal detection scheme substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art blind detection and training-based schemes in the short-pilot regime.,0,CHEAT
"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is an emerging next-generation sensor network that has a wide range of application prospects. The localization technology is one of the most important key technologies for WSN. However, in a complex indoor environment, fluctuations in received signal strength can seriously degrade positioning accuracy. In this paper, we propose a fingerprint localization method based on received signal strength (RSS) distance and improved weighted k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. The fingerprint database is established in the off-line phase. The real-time RSS values of the on-line measurement points are measured, and the two-stage RSS distance is calculated using the Euclidean distance. Finally, in order to solve the problem of non-Gaussian distribution of measurement noise, we use an improved weighted KNN algorithm to calculate the final position coordinates of the measurement point. Simulation results show that this method can reduce the influence of signal strength fluctuations and improve the positioning accuracy.",0,CHEAT

"In real-time applications, a fast and robust visual tracker should generally have the following important properties: 1) feature representation of an object that is not only efficient but also has a good discriminative capability and 2) appearance modeling which can quickly adapt to the variations of foreground and backgrounds. However, most of the existing tracking algorithms cannot achieve satisfactory performance in both of the two aspects. To address this issue, in this paper, we advocate a novel and efficient visual tracker by exploiting the excellent feature learning and classification capabilities of an emerging learning technique, that is, extreme learning machine (ELM). The contributions of the proposed work are as follows: 1) motivated by the simplicity and learning ability of the ELM autoencoder (ELM-AE), an ELM-AE-based feature extraction model is presented, and this model can provide a compact and discriminative representation of the inputs efficiently and 2) due to the fast learning speed of an ELM classifier, an ELM-based appearance model is developed for feature classification, and is able to rapidly distinguish the object of interest from its surroundings. In addition, in order to cope with the visual changes of the target and its backgrounds, the online sequential ELM is used to incrementally update the appearance model. Plenty of experiments on challenging image sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker.",0,CHEAT
"Benefit estimation is one of the key components for introducing Advanced Process Control (APC) / Multi-variable Predictive Control (MVPC) / Model Predictive Control (MPC) to a process, as the cost associated with it have to be justified in economic terms. The conventional approach to estimate benefit is based on the assumption of percentage reduction in the standard deviation of key controlled process variables, which comes from the experience and process knowledge. The conventional technique is found to be ineffective because of the uncertainty associated with it. In this research, an approach was made to develop a novel method to numerically estimate percentage reduction in the standard deviation of key controlled process variables by modelling the disturbance(s) with application to APC such that we need not assume the reduction in standard deviation while basic equation remains same as in conventional approach. The effectiveness of the proposed method is justified by implementing it in MATLAB on the real process plant data of Delayed Coker Unit (DCU) in Petrochemical refinery which experiences cyclic disturbance(s). The simulation is done by two ways, one is directly injecting the disturbance data & other is by characterizing/modelling the disturbance pattern and both the results are found to be very close. These two results were further verified by comparing with real plant data after APC has been implemented.",0,CHEAT
"An experimental data analysis to investigate the output performance of thermoelectric generator (TEG) is presented in this paper. Thermally conducting materials, Al, Fe and matte finish metal paint, are tested to study the increase in heat absorbance by TEG.

"This paper proposes an outliers-robust constant false-alarm rate (OR-CFAR) detector of Gaussian clutter based on the truncated-maximum-likelihood estimator (TMLE) in SAR imagery. The proposed method aims at elevating the detection performance in multiple-target environment, where the sea clutter samples are often contaminated by the interfering target pixels, the azimuth ambiguities, and the breakwater. As a consequence, the parameters used for statistical modeling are over-estimated, resulting in a degradation of the CFAR detection rate. Inspired by the traditional two-parameter CFAR (TP-CFAR) detector of Gaussian clutter, OR-CFAR designs an adaptive threshold-based clutter truncation method to eliminate the high-intensity outliers from the clutter samples in the local reference window, and the probability density function (PDF) of the sea clutter can be accurately modeled through the newly raised TMLE. Furthermore, the optimal truncation depth used for clutter truncation and PDF modeling is evaluated and selected properly to get the best detection results. The OR-CFAR greatly enhances the CFAR detection rate in multiple-target environment, and it is computationally simple and efficient, which has a great application value. The Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR data are used for experiments to show the better detection performance of OR-CFAR.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, data-aided sensing as a cross-layer approach in Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications is studied, where multiple IoT nodes collect measurements and transmit them to an access point (AP). It is assumed that measurements have a sparse representation (due to spatial correlation) and the notion of compressive sensing (CS) can be exploited for efficient data collection. For data-aided sensing, a node selection criterion is proposed to efficiently reconstruct a target signal through iterations with a small number of measurements from selected nodes. Together with compressive random access (CRA) to collect measurements from nodes, compressive transmission request is proposed to efficiently send a request signal to a group of selected nodes. Error analysis on compressive transmission request is carried out and the impact of errors on the performance of data-aided sensing is studied. Simulation results show that data-aided sensing allows to reconstruct the target information with a small number of active nodes and is robust to nodes' decision errors on compressive transmission request.",0,CHEAT
"We propose a progressive leaning approach to separating child speech from signals with mixed adult speech in a speaker-independent manner based on a densely connected long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to deal with limited training data issue in child speech. First, by measuring the speech dissimilarities between children and adults using i-vectors, we demonstrate that distances between child and adult speech are large enough to warrant a possible separation through establishing child and adult speech groups. Accordingly, we present a novel LSTM design with densely connected hidden layers and stacked inputs containing progressively obtained intermediate targets that are learnt via multiple-target learning for speech separation between child and adult groups. Experimental results on a simulation corpus show that the proposed framework can yield consistent and significant gains of objective measures over the LSTM baseline for child speech separation. Further-more, our preliminary results on the SeedLing corpus with realistic recordings for child language acquisition show that our approach can achieve better overall separation performances than LSTM baseline when comparing spectrograms of separated speech, implying a potential for speaker diarization involving child speech.",0,CHEAT

"Data Science has assembled researchers from multiple fields, such as computer science and marketing, to develop methods, algorithms and techniques to discover knowledge from large amounts of data and solve complex problems. The main focus is to find patterns hidden within the data. In general, these patterns must appear frequently to be learned using machine algorithms and reflect the standard, even if tacit, knowledge that guides decisions in the world. The uncovered knowledge may also reflect societal prejudice that will be enforced by the machines. Nevertheless, in many domains, specially when the negative impacts of bad decisions have a high cost, a few instances of patterns within the dataset suffice to warrant further investigation. Considering that decisions will be based on knowledge learned from the data, the challenge lies in determining when fewer appearances of a sequence of events are more important than very frequent patterns. In this context, we have devised an approach that uses a domain ontology to boost these infrequent, but relevant, events. In addition to guiding the search for relevant knowledge, the ontology helps users accept results and further investigate the data. It enables users to create data subsets and views, deriving new attributes from existing ones, guiding the data mining process, and providing a background layer from which even not so frequent patterns stand out and become meaningful. In this paper, we present our ontology-based data discovery approach, a system developed according to it, and preliminary results of a real life application in the oil production domain.",0,CHEAT
"The last few years have seen a radical shift in the cyber defense paradigm from reactive to proactive, and this change is marked by the steadily increasing trend of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing. Currently, there are numerous Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) sources providing periodically updated threat feeds that are fed into various analytical solutions. At this point, there is an excessive amount of data being produced from such sources, both structured (STIX, OpenIOC, etc.) as well as unstructured (blacklists, etc.). However, more often than not, the level of detail required for making informed security decisions is missing from threat feeds, since most indicators are atomic in nature, like IPs and hashes, which are usually rather volatile. These feeds distinctly lack strategic threat information, like attack patterns and techniques that truly represent the behavior of an attacker or an exploit. Moreover, there is a lot of duplication in threat information and no single place where one could explore the entirety of a threat, hence requiring hundreds of man hours for sifting through numerous sources - trying to discern signal from noise - to find all the credible information on a threat. We have made use of natural language processing to extract threat feeds from unstructured cyber threat information sources with approximately 70\% precision, providing comprehensive threat reports in standards like STIX, which is a widely accepted industry standard that represents CTI. The automation of an otherwise tedious manual task would ensure the timely gathering and sharing of relevant CTI that would give organizations the edge to be able to proactively defend against known as well as unknown threats.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, a novel approach is presented to solve the trajectory tracking problem for autonomous vehicles. This approach is based on the use of a cascade control where the external loop solves the position control using a novel Takagi Sugeno-Model Predictive Control (TS-MPC) approach and the internal loop is in charge of the dynamic control of the vehicle using a Takagi Sugeno-Linear Quadratic Regulator technique designed via Linear Matrix Inequalities (TS-LMI-LQR). Both techniques use a TS representation of the kinematic and dynamic models of the vehicle. In addition, a novel Takagi-Sugeno estimator-Moving Horizon Estimator-Unknown Input Observer (TS-MHE-UIO) is presented. This method estimates the dynamic states of the vehicle optimally as well as the force of friction acting on the vehicle that is used to reduce the control efforts. The innovative contribution of the TS-MPC and TS-MHE-UIO techniques is that using the TS model formulation of the vehicle allows us to solve the nonlinear problem as if it were linear, reducing computation times by 10-20 times. To demonstrate the potential of the TS-MPC, we propose a comparison between three methods of solving the kinematic control problem: Using the nonlinear MPC formulation (NL-MPC) with compensated friction force, the TS-MPC approach with compensated friction force, and TS-MPC without compensated friction force.",0,CHEAT

"Cloud manufacturing (CM) is an open and service-oriented platform that virtualizes distributed design, machining, and assembly resources together in order to provide a seamless, adaptive, and high quality transaction of manufacturing procedures. Despite the results in resource discovery and planning, the research in robustness and security of the systems falls behind in many aspects. The lack of such knowledge puts a serious challenge for the wide deployment and adoption of cloud manufacturing which is naturally connected to the Internet and exposed to cyber attacks. To bridge this gap, we study a specific type of equipment contention attack in cloud manufacturing. Through requesting extra shares of scarce resources, an attacker can gain advantage in competition with other users and reduce the efficiency of the overall system. We design a mechanism to mitigate such attacks through measuring the remaining machining capabilities in the cloud. The cloud administrator can control cost difference between the attacker and subsequent service requesters. Simulations of a mid-size city manufacturing cloud are conducted and the results show that our approach will incur low increases in cost for benign users while discouraging the equipment contention attacks.",0,CHEAT
"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been a focus area of the academic and industrial research community. They have been used in many military and civilian applications. Emergency communication is one of the essential requirements for first responders and victims in the aftermath of natural disasters. In such scenarios, UAVs may configure ad hoc wireless networks to cover a large area. In UAV networks, however, localization and routing are challenging tasks owing to the high mobility, unstable links, dynamic topology, and limited energy of UAVs. Here, we propose swarm-intelligence-based localization (SIL) and clustering schemes in UAV networks for emergency communications. First, we propose a new 3-D SIL algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that exploits the particle search space in a limited boundary by using the bounding box method. In the 3-D search space, anchor UAV nodes are randomly distributed and the SIL algorithm measures the distance to existing anchor nodes for estimating the location of the target UAV nodes. Convergence time and localization accuracy are improved with lower computational cost. Second, we propose an energy-efficient swarm-intelligence-based clustering (SIC) algorithm based on PSO, in which the particle fitness function is exploited for intercluster distance, intracluster distance, residual energy, and geographic location. For energy-efficient clustering, cluster heads are selected based on improved particle optimization. The proposed SIC outperforms five typical routing protocols regarding packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and routing overhead. Moreover, SIC consumes less energy and prolongs network lifetime.",0,CHEAT
"Security and consistency of smart grids is one of the main issues in the design and maintenance of highly controlled and monitored new power grids. Bad data injection attack could lead to disasters such as power system outage, or huge economical losses. In many attack scenarios, the attacker can come up with new attack strategies that couldn't be detected by the traditional bad data detection methods. Adaptive Partitioning State Estimation (APSE) method [3] has been proposed recently to combat such attacks. In this work, we evaluate and compare with a traditional method. The main idea of APSE is to increase the sensitivity of the chi-square test by partitioning the large grids into small ones and apply the test on each partition individually and repeat this procedure until the faulty node is located. Our simulation findings using MATPOWER program show that the method is not consistent where it is sensitive the systems size and the location of faulty nodes as well.",0,CHEAT

"Accelerating deep neural networks on resource-constrained embedded devices is becoming increasingly important for real-time applications. However, in contrast to the intensive research works on specialized neural network inference architectures, there is a lack of study on the acceleration and parallelization of deep learning inference on embedded chip-multiprocessor architectures, which are favored by many real-time applications for superb energy-efficiency and scalability. In this work, we investigate the strategies of parallelizing single-pass deep neural network inference on embedded on-chip multi-core accelerators. These methods exploit the elasticity and noise-tolerance features of deep learning algorithms to circumvent the bottleneck of on-chip inter-core data moving and reduce the communication overhead aggravated as the core number scales up.

Experimental results on the WSJ0-2mix benchmark show that the new approach can achieve better signal-to-distortion ratio and perceptual evaluation of speech quality scores than most of the state-of-the-art methods for both closed-set and open-set evaluations, even methods that exploit whole-utterance statistics for separation. It achieves this while requiring fewer model parameters.",0,CHEAT
"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently attracted considerable attention due to their outstanding accuracy in applications, such as image recognition and natural language processing. While one advantage of the CNNs over other types of neural networks is their reduced computational cost, faster execution is still desired for both training and inference. Since convolution operations pose most of the execution time, multiple algorithms were and are being developed with the aim of accelerating this type of operations. However, due to the wide range of convolution parameter configurations used in the CNNs and the possible data type representations, it is not straightforward to assess in advance which of the available algorithms will be the best performing in each particular case. In this paper, we present a performance evaluation of the convolution algorithms provided by the cuDNN, the library used by most deep learning frameworks for their GPU operations. In our analysis, we leverage the convolution parameter configurations from widely used the CNNs and discuss which algorithms are better suited depending on the convolution parameters for both 32 and 16-bit floating-point (FP) data representations. Our results show that the filter size and the number of inputs are the most significant parameters when selecting a GPU convolution algorithm for 32-bit FP data. For 16-bit FP, leveraging specialized arithmetic units (NVIDIA Tensor Cores) is key to obtain the best performance.",0,CHEAT
"This chapter gives details of Synchronous Optical NETworking (SONET)/synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) as they still exist in most of the legacy networks and more so because many of their protocols, specifically with fault tolerance and survivability, are used in the current networks with some variations. The SONET/SDH protocol had many good features of fault tolerance, availability, etc., but it lacked many key features required in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) large area optical networks. In large area optical transport networks (OTNs) WDM architecture is the norm. These networks are operated by multi‐carriers and their many interconnected domains are operated by multiple operators across the network boundaries. OTN is an important networking standard for metro networks because of its many distinguishing characteristics: it provides transport for any digital signal independent of client‐specific aspects; it can adapt to ever‐changing customer requirements and provide more effective optical network management.",0,CHEAT
"Most of the approaches used for Landslide inventory mapping (LIM) rely on traditional feature extraction and unsupervised classification algorithms. However, it is difficult to use these approaches to detect landslide areas because of the complexity and spatial uncertainty of landslides. In this letter, we propose a novel approach based on a fully convolutional network within pyramid pooling (FCN-PP) for LIM. The proposed approach has three advantages. First, this approach is automatic and insensitive to noise because multivariate morphological reconstruction is used for image preprocessing. Second, it is able to take into account features from multiple convolutional layers and explore efficiently the context of images, which leads to a good tradeoff between wider receptive field and the use of context. Finally, the selected PP module addresses the drawback of global pooling employed by convolutional neural network, FCN, and U-Net, and, thus, provides better feature maps for landslide areas. Experimental results show that the proposed FCN-PP is effective for LIM, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of five metrics, $Precision$ , $Recall$ , $Overall~Error$ , $F$ -$score$ , and $Accuracy$ .",0,CHEAT
"This paper proposes a computation offloading scheme for precedence-constrained tasks in a base station-assisted device-to-device (D2D) scenario for the information-centric Internet of Things (IC-IoT). When specified precedence among subtasks cannot be described as simple sequential or parallel relations in a task, the selection of task execution helper for subtasks offloading becomes complex due to the constraints of latency and resources. We define this type of precedence and aim to minimize the time and financial cost of computation task offloading for the user by optimizing subtask-helper pairs. This problem is modeled as a dynamic generalized multi-resource-constrained assignment problem. The optimal offloading policy is offered by searching minimum weight matchings in a bipartite graph. Computer simulations indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the random helper selection and priority-based offloading scheme.",0,CHEAT

"In recent years, multihop wireless networks have been playing a key role in many Internet of Things applications. Due to the limited resources of wireless nodes, extending the network lifetime is one of the most crucial issues, which needs to be concerned. This paper aims to maximize the network lifetime by appropriately distributing the tasks of the applications for each node in the network. First, a centralized optimal task allocation algorithm for multihop wireless networks (COTAM) is proposed by modeling the problem of maximizing the network lifetime as a linear programming (LP) problem. As the centralized algorithm requires knowing all the network parameters in advance, COTAM is mostly restricted to the off-line optimization in known environments. To extend the usability of the approach, this paper further proposes a distributed optimal task allocation algorithm (DOTAM) based on Dantzig-Wolf decomposition. DOTAM divides the centralized large-sized LP problem into small-sized subproblems, which are independently executed by each node. The proposed COTAM and DOTAM are tested by applying both the artificially generated applications and a realistic application. The extensive results demonstrate that DOTAM achieves the same performance as COTAM. Comparing with existing methods, they provide significant improvements on extending the network lifetime.",0,CHEAT
"Although person re-identification (ReID) has drawn increasing research attention due to its potential to address the problem of analysis and processing of massive monitoring data, it is very challenging to learn discriminative information when the people in the images are occluded, in large pose variations or from different perspectives. To address this problem, we propose a novel joint attention person ReID (JA-ReID) architecture. The idea is to learn two complementary feature representations by combining a soft pixel-level attention mechanism and a hard region-level attention mechanism. The soft pixel-level attention mechanism learns a discriminative embedding for the fine-grained information by exploring the salient parts in the feature maps. The hard region-level attention mechanism conducts uniform partitions on the convolutional feature maps for learning local features. We have achieved competitive results in three popular benchmarks, including Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and CUHK03. The experimental results verify the adaptability of the joint attention mechanism to non-rigid deformation of the human body, which can effectively improve the accuracy of ReID.",0,CHEAT
"Cluster Heads (CHs) in cluster based Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are considered as critical nodes since they are responsible of collecting data from cluster members, aggregating and then sending them to a sink node. The failure of CHs makes disconnected partitions in the network and hence will degrade the network performances, which makes the fault tolerance of CHs is a critical issue in WSNs. The existing fault tolerant mechanisms either consume important extra energy and time to detect and recover from the failures or need to use additional hardware and software resources. In this paper, we propose a Centralized Fault Tolerant Mechanism (CFTM) that deals efficiently with permanent and transient failures. The proposed mechanism is able to maintain the continuity of the network operation despite of CHs failures. The performance of the proposed mechanism was tested by means of simulations and compared against the Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and Informer Homed Routing (IHR) protocols. The results show that our mechanism has better performance than its counterparts in terms of energy and time costs needed to tolerate failures as well as data received at the sink.",0,CHEAT
"Completely soft robots are emerging as a compelling new platform for exploring and operating in unstructured, rugged, and dynamic environments. Unfortunately, the very properties which make soft robots so appealing also make them difficult to accurately model, scalably design, and robustly control. One of the outstanding obstacles to exploring these challenges is the relative lack of low-cost entry-level investigative model systems. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a low-cost entry-level soft robotics platform based upon modular tensegrity structures. This modular platform can scale across a variety of shapes and sizes and is capable of untethered control. We then demonstrate how unsupervised learning algorithms can be used to produce vibration-based locomotion.",0,CHEAT
"With the development of cloud server, reversible data hiding in encrypted domain has received widespread attention for management of encrypted media. Most of existing reversible data hiding methods are based on stream ciphers, which are mainly concerned with data storage security. While homomorphic ciphers focus on data processing security, which is popular in cloud and other third-party platforms. Reversible data hiding with homomorphic cryptography has been an active topic in the research filed. In this paper, we propose a new lossless data hiding method based on homomorphic cryptosystem. After a content owner generates encrypted media with homomorphic ciphers, a data hider embeds secret data by establishing a mapping between secret bits and losslessly modifying encrypted media. At the receiver side, the embedded data is extracted from encrypted domain with a little auxiliary message. And original media is recovered by directly decrypting marked encrypted media. During the embedding process, the modification of encrypted media does not change the corresponding original media owing to homomorphic and probabilistic properties. Thus, no distortion is introduced in the whole procedures of data embedding. And directly decrypted media containing embedded data is the same as the original media. Meanwhile, the proposed method achieves a high embedding rate through efficient mapping and skillful use of expanded pixel values. The experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method has higher embedding rate without distortion.",0,CHEAT
"As the demand for flexible learning increases, it is important to explore and expand online learning opportunities, especially in student supported learning. Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) is a student led academic support program designed to help students transition into university and increase student retention. PASS is offered in traditionally challenging first year core subj ects. Due to increased popularity of PASS, along with limited space and time availability, a synchronous online format (Blackboard Collaborate) was piloted in three first year University of Wollongong (UOW) subjects in the faculties of Business, Nursing, and Psychology. The aim was to test the effectiveness of the online delivery of PASS by comparing student final grade outcomes from online cohorts with face-to-face (F2F) modes, and those students who had not attended PASS. Results demonstrated that students who attended PASS obtained significantly higher marks compared to students that did not attend PASS. Final grade outcomes for F2F versus online also varied between subjects. The different result profiles for the three subjects suggests there may be different drivers for student success in the online space. This paper presents these findings providing consideration of different factors that may influence student success, with directions for future research.",0,CHEAT

"IEEE 802.11ah protocol aims at providing network connectivity to a large number of end points while maintaining a satisfactory network performance. The RAW scheme of MAC access technique enables STAs to contend in different RAW slots and thereby reducing the chance of collision. In this paper we evaluate the performance metrics of the RAW scheme and observe that RAW scheme may be suitable for very small traffic condition. At higher traffic load, some of the nodes need to wait longer to transmit packets and network becomes unstable very quickly as the traffic for each node is increased beyond two packets per second in our test condition. The highest normalized network throughput achieved in this network is around 40%. Some important performance metrics like idle probability, backoff time and transmission probability are evaluated and studied in detail in this paper.",0,CHEAT
"This research provides academic and practical contributions. From a theoretical standpoint, a hybrid harmony search (HS) algorithm, namely the oppositional global-based HS (OGHS), is proposed for solving the multi-objective flexible job-shop scheduling problems (MOFJSPs) to minimize makespan, total machine workload and critical machine workload. An initialization program embedded in opposition-based learning (OBL) is developed for enabling the individuals to scatter in a well-distributed manner in the initial harmony memory (HM). In addition, the recursive halving technique based on opposite number is employed for shrinking the neighbourhood space in the searching phase of the OGHS. From a practice-related standpoint, a type of dual vector code technique is introduced for allowing the OGHS algorithm to adapt the discrete nature of the MOFJSP. Two practical techniques, namely Pareto optimality and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS), are implemented for solving the MOFJSP. Furthermore, the algorithm performance is tested by using different strategies, including OBL and recursive halving, and the OGHS is compared with existing algorithms in the latest studies. Experimental results on representative examples validate the performance of the proposed algorithm for solving the MOFJSP.",0,CHEAT
"As Internet of Things (IoT) applications are getting attention these days, the importance of firmware security is also growing.

However, signature extraction needs the careful elaboration of experts, and it is not always even possible. In this paper, we introduce our experience in analyzing the hardware information of compressed firmware. Since it is not possible to use the semantic information of compressed binary code, we adopt machine learning technologies for this purpose.

"Environmental conditions have a significant impact on health and all human activities. On the one hand, laboratories are spaces characterized by various sources of pollution that can lead to unhealthy indoor environments. On the other hand, laboratory activities, especially in the case of experiments using thermography, require the supervision of several parameters. The proliferation of the Internet of Things paradigm (IoT) shows great potential for the creation of automatic solutions for monitoring indoor environments. In general, people spend about 90% of their time inside buildings so it is significant to use realtime monitoring systems in order to identify bad ambient conditions. The timely detection of poor ambient conditions allows you to plan interventions in the building for enhanced living environments and occupational health.

"In this paper, from the perspectives of defenders, we consider the detection problems of false data-injection attacks in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) with white noise. The false data-injection attacks usually modify the sensor data to make CPSs unstable and keep stealth for the χ2 detector. To guarantee system security, a novel detector, that is, the summation (SUM) detector, is proposed to detect the false data-injection attacks. Different from the χ2 detector, the SUM detector not only utilizes the current compromise information but also collects all historical information to reveal the threat. Its evaluation value also satisfies χ2 distribution when no attacks compromise the systems, and the false alarm rate can be restricted to less than any given value by choosing the proper threshold value. Furthermore, an improved false data-injection attack with a time-variable increment coefficient is introduced based on the existing approaches. The effects of the SUM detector are also verified for the traditional and the improved false data-injection attacks, respectively. Finally, some simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the SUM detector.",0,CHEAT

"We focus on the problem of crosstalk-aware lightpath provisioning in a dynamic, spectrally and spatially flexible optical network, in which spectral super-channels are carried over multi-core fibers with distance-adaptive transmission. The problem involves establishing a lightpath for a connection such that the inter-core crosstalk (XT) between the new lightpath and any exiting lightpaths does not cause the quality of transmission of any of these light-paths to be below an acceptable level. To this end, we analyze and compare two broad classes of schemes that aim to ensure acceptable XT levels in the network. The first is based on static/worst-case XT, whereas the second uses dynamic/ precise XT estimation. These methods are implemented in a dynamic XT-aware routing, spatial mode, and spectrum allocation algorithm that solves the lightpath-provisioning problem efficiently with the goal of minimizing bandwidth blocking. Extensive simulation experiments performed in realistic network scenarios indicate that the utilized XT estimation methodology has a significant impact on network performance, with the precise XT approach favored over the worst-case XT strategy.",0,CHEAT
"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has achieved dramatic developments in emerging Machine Learning (ML) services. Compared to online ML services, offline ML services that are full of diverse CNN workloads are common in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), research institutes and universities. Efficient scheduling and processing of multiple CNN-based tasks on SME clusters is both significant and challenging. Existing schedulers cannot predict the resource requirements of CNN-based tasks. In this paper, we propose GENIE, a QoS-guided dynamic scheduling framework for SME clusters that achieves users' QoS guarantee and high system utilization. Based on a prediction model derived from lightweight profiling, a QoS-guided scheduling strategy is proposed to identify the best placements for CNN-based tasks. We implement GENIE as a plugin of Tensorflow and experiment with real SME clusters and large-scale simulations.

"Visual Odometry (VO) is a key component in modern driver assistance systems and robotics. Meeting the real-time requirements is mandatory for VO in such applications. Previous works have primarily focused on improving accuracy at the cost of longer runtime.

In particular, computationally efficient strategies are introduced to obtain an initial set of good features and rapidly filter out the outliers to minimize the computational overhead in later stages. In addition, we propose a depth based weighting and saturated-residual scheme during pose optimization to increase the robustness of VO. Experimental results show that the proposed VO achieves the fastest speed among all the top-ranked OV and SLAM systems on KITTI leader-board. Specifically, the proposed VO is 47% faster than state-of-the-art ORB-SLAM2 with comparable accuracy on KITTI dataset.",0,CHEAT
"This paper proposes an efficient equivalent model of patch antenna for the fast prediction of its installed radiation pattern. More CPU time and memory cost are required for accurate prediction of installed radiation pattern of patch antenna on different platforms. However, a fast and efficient prediction can save CPU time and memory cost when constructing an equivalent model of patch antenna that can reproduce a similar radiation pattern to that of the patch antenna. A code is developed to determine the electric field of a magnetic dipole based on Green function derivation. The result of the radiation pattern for the far-field and near-field are computed and validated with the result using commercial software tool (FEKO). The magnetic dipole is used to construct the equivalent model of patch antenna based on the radiation mechanism to predict its installed radiation pattern. The numbers of design parameters needed to be optimized are reduced to only two parameters which are the spacing distance between the dipoles in the x- and y-directions. The height of the dipole is kept at a fixed value above the same ground plane as that of the patch antenna. This makes it more computational efficient by reducing the CPU time and memory cost. After the equivalent model is optimized with FEKO optimization tool, it is further installed on a platform to compute the installed radiation pattern. The simulation results show that the proposed equivalent model based on a magnetic dipole with only two design parameters can obtain a fast prediction of installed radiation pattern of patch antenna when mounted on a platform. The equivalent model does not require detailed geometry and material information of the patch antenna.",0,CHEAT
"Information-centric networking (ICN) is of high interest to the Internet of Things (IoT) community, since the dissemination of massive data continuously produced by IoT devices can be easily handled by ICN’s data naming scheme and inherent multipath delivery. Providing optimal multipath-oriented transmission control is crucial for ICN-IoT data delivery, but yet remains challenging because of the randomness of request arrival, dynamic link condition, and on-path caching. More prominently, the resource limitation and scalability issues in IoT require the control scheme to be lightweight and distributed. In this paper, we propose a distributed stochastic optimization framework for multipath transmission control in ICN-IoT. The transmission control, including request scheduling and data rate regulation, is formulated as a stochastic concave optimization problem, which aims to accommodate the randomness, unpredictability, and multipath delivery of ICN-IoT and maximize the overall throughput. This problem is linearly separated into two subproblems: 1) a request scheduling problem and 2) a data rate control problem, which can be individually solved per time slot. A distributed alternating descent method (DADM) is designed to optimally control the transmission by solving the aforementioned problems at client sides. DADM enables each client to sequentially update the request schedule and rate regulation via communicating the links and providers they use, which asymptotically converges to optimality while allowing low-complexity and decentralized implementation. Validated by simulations, our DADM significantly improves throughput, delay reduction, and energy efficiency, in comparison with other state-of-the-art solutions.",0,CHEAT
"The integration of satellite and terrestrial network(ISTN) is an ongoing trend in prospect. Recently many commercial companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb plan to launch tens of thousands satellites which promotes the scale of satellite networks rapidly. While the scale of the satellite network is still small relatively compared with the terrestrial network. IP-routing ability in satellite network is becoming more and more important for ISTN. Suffering from high topology dynamics, long propagation delay, and onboard processing limitations on satellite networks, routing in ISTN faces many challenges worth analyzing in-depth. This paper builds an IP-based routing usability theoretical analytical model with calculable formula, which formulates different types of networks under a unified framework that accommodates various configurations and characteristics of multiple networks. Moreover, massive experiments based on real satellite motion data are designed and conducted to analyze the routing performance and challenges in ISTN deeply, combining various ground stations, satellite processing ability, number of satellites per orbit, etc. At last, with the analysis of routing usability for ISTN, some instructive conclusions are drawn. Although the number of routing nodes in satellite networks is relatively small compared with terrestrial networks, but the influence is big. With the network scale extending, high topology dynamics makes the IP-based routing performance of ISTN decrease dramatically. Routing usable time in one day period decreases from 23.36h to 2.99h when the number of satellites grows from 60 to 960. To keep routing usability, the number of satellites in space is not the more the better in ISTN. The scale of network and the onboard processing ability should do trade off.",0,CHEAT

"Fast and accurate detection of vehicles on road traffic scenes captured by traffic surveillance cameras, is essential for large-scale deployment of automated traffic surveillance systems. The state-of-the-art techniques typically employ background modeling for low-complexity foreground detection. However, this is a challenging problem as these methods need to be robust to varying road scene conditions (such as illumination changes, camera jitter, stationary vehicles, and heavy traffic) leading to huge computation cost. In this paper, we propose a highly accurate yet low-complexity foreground (i.e., vehicle) detection technique, which can effectively deal with the varying road scene conditions, and generate accurate pixel-level foreground masks in real-time. We propose a novel robust block-based feature suitable for modeling road background and detecting vehicles as foreground, and employ Bayesian probabilistic modeling on these features. The experimental evaluations on widely used traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable accuracy to the existing state-of-the-art techniques but at a much higher processing frame rate (40x speedup over PAWCS). The real-time performance of the proposed system has also been demonstrated by implementing it on a low-cost embedded platform, Odroid XU-4, that still achieves a frame rate of over 80 frames/s, thereby enabling the real-time detection of foreground objects in road scenes.",0,CHEAT
"Solving a large-scale system of linear equations is a key step at the heart of many algorithms in scientific computing, machine learning, and beyond. When the problem dimension is large, computational and/or memory constraints make it desirable, or even necessary, to perform the task in a distributed fashion. In this paper, we consider a common scenario in which a taskmaster intends to solve a large-scale system of linear equations by distributing subsets of the equations among a number of computing machines/cores. We propose a new algorithm called Accelerated Projection-based Consensus, in which at each iteration every machine updates its solution by adding a scaled version of the projection of an error signal onto the nullspace of its system of equations, and the taskmaster conducts an averaging over the solutions with momentum. The convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in detail and analytically shown to compare favorably with the convergence rate of alternative distributed methods, namely distributed gradient descent, distributed versions of Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent and heavy-ball method, the block Cimmino method, and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. On randomly chosen linear systems, as well as on real-world data sets, the proposed method offers significant speed-up relative to all the aforementioned methods. Finally, our analysis suggests a novel variation of the distributed heavy-ball method, which employs a particular distributed preconditioning and achieves the same theoretical convergence rate as that in the proposed consensus-based method.",0,CHEAT

"To address the drastic growth of data traffic dominated by streaming of video-on-demand files, mobile edge caching/computing (MEC) can be exploited to develop intelligent content caching at mobile network edges to alleviate redundant traffic and improve content delivery efficiency. Under the MEC architecture, content providers (CPs) can deploy popular video files at MEC servers to improve users’ quality of experience (QoE). Designing an efficient content caching policy is crucial for CPs due to the content dynamics, unknown spatial-temporal traffic demands, and limited service capacity. The knowledge of users’ preference is very useful and important for efficient content caching, yet often unavailable in advance. Under this circumstance, machine learning can be used to learn the users’ preference based on historical demand information and decide the video files to be cached at the MEC servers. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based cooperative content caching policy for the MEC architecture when the users’ preference is unknown and only the historical content demands can be observed. We formulate the cooperative content caching problem as a multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem and propose a MARL-based algorithm to solve the problem. The simulation experiments are conducted based on a real dataset from MovieLens and the numerical results show that the proposed MARL-based cooperative content caching scheme can significantly reduce content downloading latency and improve content cache hit rate when compared with other popular caching schemes.",0,CHEAT
"Compressed Sensing (CS) based channel estimation techniques have recently emerged as an effective way to acquire the channel of millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems with a small number of measurements. These techniques, however, are based on prior knowledge of transmit and receive array manifolds, and assume perfect antenna arrays at both the transmitter and the receiver. In the presence of antenna imperfections, the geometry and response of the arrays are modified. This distorts the CS measurement matrix and results in channel estimation errors. This paper studies the effects of both transmit and receive antenna imperfections on the mmWave channel estimate. A relay-aided solution which corrects for errors caused by faulty transmit arrays is then proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution and show that comparable channel estimates can be obtained when compared to systems with perfect antennas without the need for additional training overhead.",0,CHEAT

"This paper presents a robust optimal neuro-adaptive controller for nonlinear systems with unstructured uncertainties. This work is also the first step towards employing control barrier functions (CBFs) for such systems to create safety constraints in the presence of disturbances. The proposed controller consists of three parts: feedforward term, adaptive term, and optimal term. The unknown dynamics of the system are estimated by a joint neural network and concurrent learning adaptation mechanism (NNCL) to inform the adaptive term. The optimal term uses an online quadratic program (QP) formulated to generate the optimal signal while providing system stability via a control Lyapunov function (CLF). The CBFs and control bounds (CBs) constraints are incorporated into the QP structure to create safety conditions on the system and bound the control effort. A robust term robustifies the proposed controller to disturbances and uncancelled uncertainty. The end result is a QP-RCLBF-NNCL controller for which uniformly ultimately boundedness of all system signals is proven using Lyapunov synthesis. The proposed controller is validated on an inverted pendulum. Simulation results show that the controller achieves good tracking performance and model identification. Two safety tests are performed to show that the proposed controller is able to bound the control signal and velocity by their predefined values when a disturbance acts on the system.",0,CHEAT
"Most of existing community detection algorithms group nodes with more connections into the same community, and they are more concerned with links within the community. However, the weak ties between different communities are also important, because they can reflect the relationships between different communities, including helpful, friendly or negative, and adverse. Few studies focus on weak ties, although they are important. In this paper, we propose a novel sign prediction model based on the nodes features in the network, including the Jaccard similarity and the ratio of the negative degrees of all nodes, and the autoencoder technology that self-defines its loss function with the features of the communities. The proposed model maps the original network to a low-dimensional space so that the weak ties can be represented by low-dimensional vectors. We conduct experiments on the Epinions and Slashdot datasets and find that the proposed model outperforms the challenging state-of-the-art graph embedding methods in the sign prediction of weak ties in terms of accuracy and F1 score measurement.",0,CHEAT
"Radiomics is a rapidly growing field that deals with modeling the textural information present in the different tissues of interest for clinical decision support. However, the process of generating radiomic images is computationally very expensive and could take substantial time per radiological image for certain higher order features, such as, gray-level co-occurrence matrix(GLCM), even with high-end GPUs. To that end, we developed RadSynth, a deep convolutional neural network(CNN) model, to efficiently generate radiomic images. RadSynth was tested on a breast cancer patient cohort of twenty-four patients(ten benign, ten malignant and four normal) for computation of GLCM entropy images from post-contrast DCE-MRI. RadSynth produced excellent synthetic entropy images compared to traditional GLCM entropy images. The average percentage difference and correlation between the two techniques were 0.07 ± 0.06 and 0.97, respectively. In conclusion, RadSynth presents a new powerful tool for fast computation and visualization of the textural information present in the radiological images.",0,CHEAT
"Adaptive channel coding and power control for practical free-space optical communication systems are proposed in this paper. Particularly, we first assume that the channel state information (CSI) is perfectly known at the transmitter, and propose adaptive transmission schemes in which coding rate is adjusted either independently or jointly with transmit power according to the channel conditions. Moreover, an optimization problem is developed to attain power consumption minimization under free space optical (FSO) practical constraints, i.e., target bit-error rate, target outage probability, and maximum transmit power. We then solve the optimization problem and derive closed-form expressions for throughput and average transmit power for both adaptive schemes over the Gamma-Gamma atmospheric turbulence channels. Our results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed adaptive schemes over non-adaptive schemes, especially under strong turbulence conditions. In the second part of this paper, we move toward a more realistic scenario where the channel is not perfectly known to Tx/Rx and is estimated by the sequence of received signals. Therefore, we investigate the effect of channel estimation inaccuracies on the performance of the proposed schemes and show that the accuracy of the channel estimator depends on the length of the sequence and, for a sufficiently large length of the observation window, it achieves performance close to the receiver with known CSI. Extensive analytical derivations are provided to investigate the performance of the proposed adaptive schemes under channel estimation error. Our analytical results can be used for calculating and tuning of the optimum length of the observation window without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations.",0,CHEAT
"To improve the diagnostic accuracy rate of multiple parameter faults in widely used power electronic circuits, solving for the overlapping parameter fault characteristic signal is crucial. This paper proposes a novel approach for diagnosing the multiple parameter faults of power electronic circuits that can adaptively adjust the weights of each fault feature parameter according to the diagnostic accuracy rate to enhance their discriminability. According to the properties of multiple parameter faults in power electronic circuits, the measured signal that has been decomposed via the variational mode decomposition and wavelet packet energy entropy (VMD-WPEE) is used to extract the feature parameters. Furthermore, a classifier is selected and the threshold of the diagnostic accuracy rate is set. Then, the weight of each fault feature parameter is adjusted until the classifier yields the desired results. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to other classifiers and feature extraction methods. The high accuracy, high robustness, and advantages of the multiple-parameter-fault diagnosis method are demonstrated by the simulation and experimental results.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, we propose a deep multiple description coding framework, whose quantizers are adaptively learned via the minimization of multiple description compressive loss. Firstly, our framework is built upon auto-encoder networks, which have multiple description multi-scale dilated encoder network and multiple description decoder networks. Secondly, two entropy estimation networks are learned to estimate the informative amounts of the quantized tensors, which can further supervise the learning of multiple description encoder network to represent the input image delicately. Thirdly, a pair of scalar quantizers accompanied by two importance-indicator maps is automatically learned in an end-to-end self-supervised way. Finally, multiple description structural dissimilarity distance loss is imposed on multiple description decoded images in pixel domain for diversified multiple description generations rather than on feature tensors in feature domain, in addition to multiple description reconstruction loss. Through testing on two commonly used datasets, it is verified that our method is beyond several state-of-the-art multiple description coding approaches in terms of coding efficiency.",0,CHEAT

After that, we illustrate the process of building back door. Lastly, we introduce the obfuscation technology applied in the APT malware samples.",0,CHEAT
"Melanoma skin cancer is one of the most deadly forms of cancer which are responsible for thousands of deaths. The manual process of melanoma diagnosis is a time taking and difficult task, therefore researchers introduced several computerized methods for recognition. Through computational methods, improves the accuracy of diagnostics process which is helpful for dermatologists. In this paper, we proposed an automated system for skin lesion classification through transfer learning based deep neural network (DCNN) features extraction and kurtosis controlled principle component (KcPCA) based optimal features selection. The pre-trained ResNet deep neural network such as RESNET-50 and RESNET-101 are utilized for features extraction. Then fused their information and selects the best features which later fed to supervised learning method such as SVM of radial basis function (RBF) for classification. Three datasets name HAM10000, ISBI 2017, and ISBI 2016 are utilized for experimental results and achieved an accuracy of 89.8%, 95.60%, and 90.20%, respectively. The overall results show that the performance of the proposed system is reliable as compared to existing techniques.",0,CHEAT
"Given a tiny face image, existing face hallucination methods aim at super-resolving its high-resolution (HR) counterpart by learning a mapping from an exemplary dataset. Since a low-resolution (LR) input patch may correspond to many HR candidate patches, this ambiguity may lead to distorted HR facial details and wrong attributes such as gender reversal and rejuvenation. An LR input contains low-frequency facial components of its HR version while its residual face image, defined as the difference between the HR ground-truth and interpolated LR images, contains the missing high-frequency facial details. We demonstrate that supplementing residual images or feature maps with additional facial attribute information can significantly reduce the ambiguity in face super-resolution. To explore this idea, we develop an attribute-embedded upsampling network, which consists of an upsampling network and a discriminative network. The upsampling network is composed of an autoencoder with skip-connections, which incorporates facial attribute vectors into the residual features of LR inputs at the bottleneck of the autoencoder, and deconvolutional layers used for upsampling. The discriminative network is designed to examine whether super-resolved faces contain the desired attributes or not and then its loss is used for updating the upsampling network. In this manner, we can super-resolve tiny (16×16 pixels) unaligned face images with a large upscaling factor of 8× while reducing the uncertainty of one-to-many mappings remarkably. By conducting extensive evaluations on a large-scale dataset, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior face hallucination results and outperforms the state-of-the-art.",0,CHEAT
"Due to densification of wireless networks, there exist abundance of idling computation resources at (network) edge helpers (e.g., base stations and handheld computers). These resources can be scavenged by offloading heavy computation tasks from small Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices (e.g., sensors and wearable computing devices) in proximity, thereby overcoming their limitations and lengthening their battery lives. However, unlike dedicated servers, the spare resources offered by edge helpers are random and intermittent. Thus, it is essential to intelligently control a user (IoT device) the amounts of data for offloading and local computing so as to ensure that a computation task can be finished in time-consuming minimum energy. In this paper, we design energy-efficient control policies in a computation offloading system with a random channel and a helper with a dynamically loaded CPU (due to the primary service). Specifically, the policy adopted by the helper aims at determining the sizes of offloaded and locally computed data for a given task in different slots such that the total energy consumption for transmission and local CPU is minimized under a task-deadline constraint. As the result, the polices endow an offloading user robustness against channel-and-helper randomness besides balancing offloading and local computing. By modeling the channel and helper CPU as Markov chains, the problem of offloading control is converted into a Markov decision process. Though dynamic programming (DP) for numerically solving the problem does not yield the optimal policies in closed form, we leverage the procedure to quantify the optimal policy structure and apply the result to design optimal or sub-optimal policies. For three cases ranging from zero, small to large helper buffers, the low complexity of the policies overcomes the “curse of dimensionality” in DP arising from joint consideration of channel, helper CPU, and buffer states.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, a novel data-driven information hiding scheme called “generative steganography by sampling” (GSS) is proposed. Unlike in traditional modification-based steganography, in our method the stego image is directly sampled by a powerful generator: no explicit cover is used. Both parties share a secret key used for message embedding and extraction. The Jensen-Shannon divergence is introduced as a new criterion for evaluating the security of generative steganography. Based on these principles, we propose a simple practical generative steganography method that uses semantic image inpainting. The message is written in advance to an uncorrupted region that needs to be retained in the corrupted image. Then, the corrupted image with the secret message is fed into a Generator trained by a generative adversarial network (GAN) for semantic completion. Message loss and prior loss terms are proposed for penalizing message extraction error and unrealistic stego image. In our design, we first train a generator whose training target is the generation of new data samples from the same distribution as that of existing training data. Next, for the trained generator, backpropagation to the message and prior loss are introduced to optimize the coding of the input noise data for the generator. The presented experiments demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework based on both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the generated stego images.",0,CHEAT
"Local binary descriptor constitutes power visual cues for feature representation. They provide discriminative information about small appearance details in local neighbourhoods. So, they are robust to local changes databases such as illumination, identity, and expression. Unlike existing local descriptors is not discriminatory enough to estimate the relationship between two people. This is mainly due to the learning feature code individually and the hand-crafted features which previous knowledge is required. In this paper, we propose an effective Context-Aware Local Binary Feature Learning (CA-LBFL)for kinship verification in order to solve the proposed problem. (CA-LBFL)a method has applied to learn contextual features from raw pixels directly and to eliminates the dependence on hand-crafted features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive results compared with other states-of-the-art.",0,CHEAT
"In order to identify a specific system (module) of interest embedded in a dynamic network, one typically has to formulate a multi-input single-output (MISO) identification problem which requires to identify all modules in the MISO structure, and determine their model order. While the former task poses the problem of estimating a large number of parameters that are of no interest to the experimenter, the latter task may result computationally challenging in large-size networks. To avoid these issues and increase the accuracy of the identified module of interest, we use regularized kernel-based methods. Keeping a parametric model for the module of interest, we model the impulse response of the remaining modules in the MISO structure as zero mean Gaussian vectors with covariance matrix (kernel) given by the first-order stable spline kernel, accounting also for the noise model affecting the output of the target model. Using an Empirical Bayes (EB) approach, the target-module parameters are estimated by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the module output. The related optimization problem is solved using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Numerical experiments illustrate the potentials of the introduced method in comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques for local identification.",0,CHEAT
"Spell Checker is an important part of language specific text processing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach for spell checker for Punjabi language.

To correct misspelled words, best possible suggestion is listed using Long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network along with rule based approach and minimum edit distance. Error detection using trie-based dictionary improves the performance and Error correction using LSTM improves the accuracy of proposed spell checker. In addition to error detection techniques and error correction techniques, proposed spell checker uses handcrafted rules, language syntax rules and rules regarding tokenization.",0,CHEAT
"It is generally conceded that, due to security and privacy concerns, enterprises and users are reluctant to embrace the cloud computing paradigm and hence benefit from the cost reductions and the increased flexibility or business agility that this paradigm brings about. These concerns stem mainly from the significantly-expanded attack surfaces that result from the heterogeneous nature of cloud services and the dynamicity inherent in cloud environments. In order to alleviate these concerns, effective and flexible access control approaches are required to consider the contextual parameters that characterise data access requests in the cloud. In this respect, this work presents PaaSword: a novel holistic access control framework—essentially a PaaS offering—that extends the popular XACML standard with semantic reasoning capabilities that support the federation of effective context-aware access control policies and their infusion into cloud applications with minimal manual intervention and effort. To determine the performance of our solution, a comparative evaluation test is presented and discussed, against a well-known reference implementation of the XACML standard, namely the open source WSO2 Balana engine.",0,CHEAT
"The gateway selection is an essential issue in hybrid mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Current independent and random selections without supporting routing negotiation protocol may cause links or gateways overloaded when they are selected by multiple nodes simultaneously. Therefore, the network performance may not be in a proper way. Furthermore, the ad hoc nature of MANETs makes the topology change dynamically, so that the gateway selection becomes even more difficult. This paper presents a mathematical model for gateway capability and a novel approach, called bio-inspired gateway selection, where the gateways are selected according to the network status and associated with a cooperative mechanism for optimization. The novelty includes the use of attractor selection model, the self-adaptability and the autonomy of the biological system. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulation with different scenarios and compared with the conventional approaches being currently used in hybrid MANETs. The illustrated numerical results present the performance of the proposed approach in terms of packet delivery ratio, average delivery latency, normalized routing overhead, and gateway load balance under different network conditions. Furthermore, the numerical results are also able to demonstrate the significant performance gain compared with the conventional gateway selection approaches.",0,CHEAT
"This paper explores Cumulative Citation Recommendation (CCR) for Knowledge Base Acceleration (KBA). The CCR task aims to detect potential citations of a set of target entities with priorities from a volume of temporally-ordered stream corpus. Previous approaches for CCR that build an individual relevance model for each entity fail to deal with unseen entities without annotation. A compromised solution is to build a global entity-unspecific model for all entities without respect to the relationship information among entities, which cannot guarantee achieving a satisfactory result for each entity. Moreover, most previous methods can not adequately exploit prior knowledge embedded in entities or documents due to considering all kinds of features indifferently. In this paper, we propose a novel entity and document class-dependent discriminative mixture model by introducing one intermediate layer to model the correlation between entity-document pairs and hybrid latent entity-document classes. The model can better adjust to different types of entities and documents, and achieve better performance when dealing with a broad range of entity and document classes. An extensive set of experiments has been conducted on two offical datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.",0,CHEAT
"Nowadays, more attention has been placed on cost reductions and yield enhancement in the semiconductor industry. During the manufacturing process, a considerable amount of sensor data called status variables identification (SVID) is collected by sensors embedded in advanced machines. This data is a valuable source for data-driven automatic fault detection and diagnosis at an early manufacturing stage to maintain competitive advantages. However, wafer processing times vary slightly from wafer to wafer, resulting in variable-length signal data. The conventional approaches use much condensed data called fault detection and classification (FDC) data made by manually designed feature extraction. Or, recent deep learning approaches assume that all wafers have the same processing time, which is impotent to the variable-length SVID. To detect and diagnose faults directly from the variable-length SVID, we propose a self-attentive convolutional neural network. In experiments using real-world data from a semiconductor manufacturer, the proposed model outperformed other deep learning models with less training time and showed robustness at different sequence lengths. Compared to FDC data, SVID data showed better fault detection performance. Without manually investigating the lengthy sensor signals, abnormal sensor value patterns were found at the time specified by the model.",0,CHEAT
"Prediction of protein subcellular location has currently become a hot topic because it has been proven to be useful for understanding both the disease mechanisms and novel drug design. With the rapid development of automated microscopic imaging technology in recent years, classification methods of bioimage-based protein subcellular location have attracted considerable attention for images can describe the protein distribution intuitively and in detail. In the current study, a prediction method of protein subcellular location was proposed based on multi-view image features that are extracted from three different views, including the four texture features of the original image, the global and local features of the protein extracted from the protein channel images after color segmentation, and the global features of DNA extracted from the DNA channel image. Finally, the extracted features were combined together to improve the performance of subcellular localization prediction. From the performance comparison of different combination features under the same classifier, the best ensemble features could be obtained. In this work, a classifier based on Stacked Auto-encoders and the random forest was also put forward. To improve the prediction results, the deep network was combined with the traditional statistical classification methods. Stringent cross-validation and independent validation tests on the benchmark dataset demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method.",0,CHEAT
"We propose an optimization approach for determining both hardware and software parameters for the efficient implementation of a (family of) applications called dense stencil computations on programmable general purpose computing on graphics processing units. We first introduce a simple, analytical model for the silicon area usage of accelerator architectures and a workload characterization of stencil computations. We combine this characterization with a parametric execution-time model and formulate a mathematical optimization problem that seeks to maximize a common objective function of all the hardware and software parameters. The solution to this problem, therefore, “solves” the codesign problem: simultaneously choosing software-hardware parameters to optimize total performance. We validate this approach by proposing architectural variants of the NVIDIA Maxwell GTX-980 (respectively, Titan X) specifically tuned to a predetermined workload of four common 2-D stencils (Heat, Jacobi, Laplacian, and Gradient) and two 3-D ones (Heat and Laplacian). Our model predicts that performance would potentially improve by 28% (respectively, 33%) with simple tweaks to the hardware parameters, such as tuning the number of streaming multiprocessors, the number of compute cores each contains, and the size of shared memory.

"The proliferation of various mobile devices equipped with cameras results in an exponential growth of the amount of images. Recent advances in the deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNN) have made CNN feature extraction become an effective way to process these images. However, it is still a challenging task to deploy the CNN model on the mobile sensors, which are typically resource-constrained in terms of the storage space, the computing capacity, and the battery life. Although cloud computing has become a popular solution, data security and response latency are always the key issues. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight framework for privacy-preserving CNN feature extraction for mobile sensing based on edge computing. To get the most out of the benefits of CNN with limited physical resources on the mobile sensors, we design a series of secure interaction protocols and utilize two edge servers to collaboratively perform the CNN feature extraction. The proposed scheme allows us to significantly reduce the latency and the overhead of the end devices while preserving privacy. Through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, we demonstrate the security, effectiveness, and efficiency of our scheme.",0,CHEAT
"Power-over-fibre (POF) has been demonstrated for remotely powering microelectronic devices in hazardous environments [1] and in telecommunication and smart grid applications [2]. The technique can also be used for supplying power to surveillance cameras which reduces their vulnerability to tampering [3]. Ultimately, POF will have significant applications in the development and implementation of all-optical sensor networks. However, there is a limit to the amount of power that can be transmitted via the optical fibre due to processes such as stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) [4]. As such, the aim of this study is to optimise the power delivered to different parts of an optical fibre network, in order to minimise the effects of processes such as SBS. This can be achieved by enhancing the performance of the photovoltaic microcell (also called a photovoltaic power converter, PPC) and tailoring it to match the power requirements of sensors or actuators scattering throughout the network.",0,CHEAT

"In the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of physical devices are connected and provide a near real-time state of the world. By adopting a service-oriented computing paradigm, the capabilities of these devices (whether mobile or static) can be abstracted as IoT services and delivered to users in a demand-driven way. Service providers can have a comprehensive competitive edge by tailoring their services to match users' requests through a negotiation process, with the particular service provisioning specified in a service level agreement (SLA), which can be further used to monitor and guarantee the quality of service (QoS). The challenges for SLA negotiation in the IoT include the scale and the dynamics of the environment. Existing SLA negotiation approaches are focused on cloud computing, which do not consider the domain-specific properties of IoT services. In this paper, we designed a context-based negotiation strategy to evaluate offers and generate counteroffers, and integrate it with the WS-Agreement Negotiation standard. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposal can produce a higher utility and maintain a good success rate compared to other negotiation strategies.",0,CHEAT
"The prodigious data generated by all kinds of smart devices creates the need for an efficient and reliable platform which should be capable of managing huge data traffic. To overcome the acute load on the cloud and achieve low latency for real-time applications, the computation has been moved to distributed edge devices, i.e., fog/edge computing. However, the capability of end devices is not on par with the cloud.

The major functions of our platform include service auto discover, lightweight container provisioning, GPU container support for deep learning applications, manage all active end nodes without a fixed IP address, secure remote deployment of edge analytic applications, and joint edge/cloud data communication and processing. To minimize the service downtime and guarantee high availability of edge services, we propose a real-time internal and external container migration scheme to achieve cooperative processing, load balancing, data backup, and service failover. Comparing with existing edge platforms, our solution achieves lightweight service management, low overhead, flexible and secure networking, and the significant reduction in latency.",0,CHEAT

"Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition is carried out in various studies to read patterns. Various sensors can be used to capture dynamic hand movement patterns. The results of the initial reading are usually in the form of raw data that must pass initial processing. Advanced processing is carried out to obtain features that will be trained using various classifiers. The recognition process without feature selection activities will reduce the accuracy of pattern recognition during the classification process. Seeing the many shortcomings in the implementation of the initial data processing, this study will present some initial processing examples to produce features that are relatively good for the data training process.

Besides the geometrical information of point cloud, the color has great potential to assist the point cloud registration. In this paper, we propose a registration method by adaptively combining with color moment information to improve the registration accuracy. Firstly, three kinds of central moments are used to characterize the color distribution of two point clouds. And then, we build the correspondence between point clouds by dynamically combining the geometric feature and color moment feature of each point, hence the corresponding points satisfy both geometric similarity and color similarity. Finally, for the partial registration problem in practice, we apply the trimmed ICP algorithm framework to calculate the rigid transformation. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is more robust and accurate in dealing with point cloud geometry defects, missing data and poor initial position.",0,CHEAT

"Effort has been made to find biomarkers for vascular dementia (VaD). Nevertheless, the current findings are typically obtained through statistical tests of group level differences. In clinical practice, however, it is more common to perform individual level inferences, e.g., to determine if a subject is suffering from VaD, which cannot be resolved with statistical analysis. The goal of this study is to develop a method to effectively discriminate early VaD patients from normal controls by combining EEG features with machine learning methods. The EEG signals were recorded from a total of 15 VaD patients and 21 controls during a visual oddball task. Interregional directed connectivity was derived from directed transfer function (DTF) analysis and used as features in classification. Three machine learning methods, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), error back-propagation (BP) neural network, and support vector machine (SVM) were used as classifiers, and their classification performance was compared. It was found that VaD patients can be effectively identified using the BP and SVM classifiers with high accuracy. In particular, when the SVM classifier was combined with feature selection by Fisher score, it reached an accuracy 86.11%, sensitivity 86.67%, and specificity 85.71%. The area under the curve (AUC, 0.854) indicates a good identification of VaD patients from the normal controls. Since the EEG is noninvasive, inexpensive, and widely available to use, the current study presents a novel clinical application of machine learning methods and could facilitate automatic screening and diagnosis of the VaD at an early stage in future.",0,CHEAT
"This paper is concerned with the sliding mode control (SMC) via finite-time stabilization (FTS) for a class of conic-type nonlinear semi-Markovian jumping systems (SMJSs). Comparing with the classical Markovian jumping systems, the transition rates of SMJSs are related to the random sojourn-time g. Based on this, a suitable SMC law for driving the state trajectories to the designed sliding surface within a finite-time interval is given. Then, the FTS over reaching phase and sliding motion phase is further proved to guarantee the FTS of the whole SMJSs. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a time-delayed Chua's circuit simulation.",0,CHEAT
"Human activity recognition substantiates itself as a useful tool applicable in many smart assistive technologies. Gathering, evaluating, and analyzing data in order to recognize human activities poses many issues, especially in healthcare applications. This paper seeks to answer the question what are the issues regarding the human activity recognition process in healthcare. After conducting a review of approaches used to implement each stage of a specific activity recognition process, the results indicated that issues mostly arise in data collection stage. Based on that, the applicability of related approaches (i.e., wearables, smartphones, and non-contact sensing) is discussed. Underlying issues are identified in order to serve as a starting point for future research activities.",0,CHEAT
"For the first time, the combination of mutual information analysis and correlation power analysis is proposed to enhance the accuracy and success rate of side channel analysis. Using the k-nearest-neighborhood (KNN) algorithm, correlation power analysis is combined with mutual information analysis to classify various possible keys to two classes of correct and wrong keys. The advantage of the combination of the distinguishers is two fold. First, the accuracy of the estimation is enhanced due to availability of multiple possible values for the correct key. Second, the number of measurements required to disclose the correct key is reduced by combining the distinguishers. The effectiveness of combined distinguisher is verified by extensive simulations. The number of measurements required to perform a side channel attack with a success rate of 90% is improved, respectively, by 20% and 49%, as compared to individual correlation power analysis and mutual information analysis.",0,CHEAT
"In energy-from-waste plants, combustible waste is first carried into the process plant by garbage trucks, which unload the solid waste into a large waste pit. The solid waste collected in the waste pit is then carried into the incinerator using a waste crane. In order to stabilize the combustion process, it is important to keep the waste composition similar, by breaking the plastic containers and mixing the garbage well. Various constraints on crane operations including the limited space in the waste pit, time and energy conservation constraints, make fully automatic crane operation a very complex and difficult problem. In this paper, a fully automatic waste crane scheduler applying evolutionary computation is proposed. The proposed waste crane scheduler was successfully tested in an actual energy-from-waste plant, and it was verified that the waste deposited in the incinerator was mixed better using the proposed waste crane scheduler.",0,CHEAT
"This paper proposes fast convergent distributed algorithms for weighted average consensus of input data. For acyclic graphs, we give an algorithm that converges to the exact weighted average consensus in a finite number of iterations, equal to the graph diameter. For loopy (cyclic) graphs, we offer two remedies. In the first one, we give another distributed algorithm to enable our average consensus algorithm applicable to a loopy graph by converting it into a spanning tree. In the second one, we consider a slightly modified average consensus problem whose optimal solution approximates the consensus solution with arbitrary precision, and give a modified average consensus algorithm with guaranteed exponential convergence to the optimal solution. The proposed average consensus algorithms enjoy low complexities, robustness to transmission adversaries, and asynchronous implementation. Our algorithms are conceptually different from the popular graph Laplacian approach, and converge much faster than the latter approach.",0,CHEAT
"Vision-to-language tasks aim to integrate computer vision and natural language processing together, which has attracted the attention of many researchers. For typical approaches, they encode image into feature representations and decode it into natural language sentences. While they neglect high-level semantic concepts and subtle relationships between image regions and natural language elements. To make full use of these information, this paper attempt to exploit the text-guided attention and semantic-guided attention (SA) to find the more correlated spatial information and reduce the semantic gap between vision and language. Our method includes two-level attention networks. One is the text-guided attention network which is used to select the text-related regions. The other is SA network which is used to highlight the concept-related regions and the region-related concepts. At last, all these information are incorporated to generate captions or answers. Practically, image captioning and visual question answering experiments have been carried out, and the experimental results have shown the excellent performance of the proposed approach.",0,CHEAT
"Although the convolutional neural networks have obtained amazing performance in the area of image search, most of the existing methods are applied for natural images collected via normal lens without anamorphic distortion. Actually, there are great amounts of images collected with a circular fisheye lens to obtain larger field-of-view (FOV), especially in the area of natural science study. This paper aims to present a novel image search method with saliency deep features for those images, especially the aurora images used in solar-terrestrial space research. Our method exploits the advanced Mask R-CNN framework to extract semantic features. To utilize the unique physical characteristics of aurora and focus on the most informative local regions, we present a saliency proposal network (SPN) to take place in the region proposal network (RPN). In our SPN, different from the conventional rectangular gridding way, the proposed anchors show spherical distortion determined by imaging principle and magnetic information. In addition, instead of the horizontal directions, our anchor boxes direct perpendicular to the physical magnetic meridian, and thus ensure them to include the auroral structures within minimum areas. We perform numerous experiments on the big aurora image dataset, and the results prove the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods on both search accuracy and efficiency.",0,CHEAT
"The clustering technique is a kind of key method used to balance energy consumption in wireless sensor networks. It can increase the lifetime of the network and scalability. Energy-efficient clustering algorithms should be designed for the characteristic of homogeneous WSN. We propose and evaluate a new centralized energy-efficient clustering protocol for homogenous WSNs, which is called Distance energy evaluated DEE. In DEE, the cluster-heads (CHs), are elected by a probability based on the ratio between distance and residual energy of each node. The probability of being CH according to their initial and residual energy. Finally, the simulation results seemed that DEE achieves more effective messages and longer lifetime than current important clustering protocols in homogeneous environments.",0,CHEAT

"Advertisements are an integral part of internet economics and culture, and video ads are the most popular and arguably the most entertaining form of advertisements. With the recent growth in digital marketing, video ads have seen unprecedented growth and are growing in importance as an advertising means. Video ads are expensive to create and are not always effective. The effectiveness of a video ad is usually not known before its deployment, which is non-ideal for creators, advertisers, and ad platforms. In this paper, we outline an idea to provide feedback before an ad is placed on its effectiveness based on the video along with the historical data about the effectiveness of other video ads. We propose a multi-modal mixture based algorithm to predict the effectiveness automatically. Specifically, we exploit rich textual information often found with an advertisement as well as visual information to learn a finite mixture model. Our experiments on a publicly available dataset show that our approach can outperform other baseline approaches.",0,CHEAT
"This paper aims to study the Mittag-Leffler stabilization of an unstable time fractional hyperbolic partial differential equation by boundary control and boundary measurement. The backstepping method, the fractional Lyapunov method, and the semigroup theory are adopted in the investigation. A novel state feedback control via the Dirichlet boundary is designed to stabilize the controlled system. Based on the output signal, we first construct an observer that can recover the state of the original system, and then, we propose an observer-based stabilizing control law, under which the closed-loop system is shown to admit a unique solution and to be Mittag-Leffler stable. Finally, a benchmark example is presented to test the proposed theory.",0,CHEAT
"Individual recognition of communication emitter can obtain the working mechanism, system parameters, and the usage model of the emitters based on the separation and interception of the specific emitter signals. In order to realize the individual recognition of communication emitter, a method of communication emitter recognition based on wavelet packet feature extraction and attribute reduction of granular computing is proposed. The method uses hierarchical and granularity to represent the subtle feature information of different emitter signals contained in the original data after the decomposition of wavelet packet, so that the feature attributes of different emitters are efficiently mapped to different levels of granular structure which can be used to search for an optimal reduced attributes operation for signal recognition. And then, the reduced attributes are used to distinguish the emitter signals correctly by label propagation method. The experimental results show that the proposed method based on wavelet packet feature extraction and granular computing attribute reduction has good classification performance in individual recognition of communication emitters.",0,CHEAT
"This paper focuses on the finite-time control issue for a class of uncertain nonlinearly parameterized systems under arbitrary switching. By using the adding a power integrator technique (APIT), a new adaptive controller with a tuning parameter is designed. Different from the previous results, we develop a new common Lyapunov function (CLF) with a tuning parameter to achieve the global finite-time stability (GFTS) for the closed-loop switched systems. It is proved that all the states of the considered switched systems converge to an equilibrium state in finite time. Some simulations are given to illustrate the feasibility and advantages of the suggested approach.",0,CHEAT
"Due to the growing complexities of Integrated Circuits (ICs) and the current trend of Intellectual Property (IP) based hardware designs, the possible threats of Hardware Trojans are inevitable. Trojans can be inserted during the design or fabrication phase of the IC design cycle by an untrustworthy third party. A Trojan once implanted in a system component can cause an unintended modification in the system functionality resulting in a considerable performance penalty or even a system crash. The malicious activity by a Trojan may include access to highly sensitive data, thus increasing the system vulnerability. A malicious Trojan once activated, can continue to inject memory transaction through the system interconnect. Such memory transactions may result in unnecessary invalidation broadcast as well as the eviction of valid cache lines and hence resulting in a huge degradation in system performance. Even a malicious activity by a Trojan can designate an upper level cache hit for a cache line to a cache miss resulting in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. This type of attack in turn greatly increases lower level memory traffic. In this work, we have considered such stealthy Trojans and evaluate their effects on the performance of a real-time many-core system. We have used machine learning based techniques for run-time detection of such Trojans. Simulation results show more than 95% accuracy in detection.",0,CHEAT
"Many mobile systems and wearable devices, such as Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) headsets, lack a keyboard or touchscreen to type an ID and password for signing into a virtual website. However, they are usually equipped with gesture capture interfaces to allow the user to interact with the system directly with hand gestures. Although gesture-based authentication has been well-studied, less attention is paid to the gesture-based user identification problem, which is essentially an input method of account ID and an efficient searching and indexing method of a database of gesture signals. In this paper, we propose FMHash (i.e., Finger Motion Hash), a user identification framework that can generate a compact binary hash code from a piece of in-air-handwriting of an ID string. This hash code enables indexing and fast search of a large account database using the in-air-handwriting by a hash table. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, we implemented a prototype and achieved ≥99.5% precision and ≥92.6% recall with exact hash code match on a dataset of 200 accounts collected by us. The ability of hashing in-air-handwriting pattern to binary code can be used to achieve convenient sign-in and sign-up with in-air-handwriting gesture ID on future mobile and wearable systems connected to the Internet.",0,CHEAT
"In addition to controlling the influx of light to the retina, the pupil also reacts as a result of cognitive and emotional processing. This makes it possible to use pupil dilation as an index for cognitive effort and emotional arousal. We show how an extended version of a computational model of pupil dilation can account for pupillary contagion effects where the pupil of an observer dilates upon seeing another person with dilated pupils. We also show how the model can reproduce the effects of cognitive effort in a math exercise. Furthermore, we investigate how the model can account for different explanations for the abnormal pupil response seen in individuals with or at risk for autism spectrum disorder. The reported computer simulations illustrate the usefulness of system-level models of the brain in addressing complex cognitive and emotional phenomena.",0,CHEAT
"With large-scale distributed generators (DGs) penetrated into the active distribution network (ADN), conventional load flow convergence failure is incurred by heavy power transmission. The Holomorphic Embedding Load Flow Method (HELM) has proven to be more robust than the Newton-Raphson method under heavy power transmission and is not sensitive to the initial points. At present, HELM is mainly designed for balanced transmission networks. In this study, we developed a three-phase HELM model to accommodate DGs, delta connection loads, and ZIP loads for ADN. The effectiveness and better performance of the proposed method under heavy load situations were validated using modified unbalanced IEEE 13, 34, 37, and 123 test feeders.",0,CHEAT
"In general, aerial mapping is an image registration problem, i.e., the problem of transforming different sets of images into one coordinate system. Aerial mapping is one of the important capability of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Here, the images processed by the registration system is strongly influenced by the quality of the image captured by the UAV. To select the image that will be processed efficiently is not easy considering the ground truth in the mapping process is not given before the UAV flies and captures the image. On the other hand, generally, UAV will fly and take the image in sequence regardless of the quality. These will result in several issues, such as: 1) the quality of mapping results becomes bad, and 2) the computational cost of registration process becomes high. To tackle such issues, therefore, we need a recognition system that is able to recognize images that should be excluded from the registration process. In this paper, we define such image as an “inclined image,” i.e., images captured by UAV not perpendicular with the ground. Although we can calculate the inclination angle using a gyroscope attached to the UAV, our interest here is to recognize the images without the use of such sensor like human do. To realize that, we utilize a deep learning method to build an inclined image recognition system. We tested our proposed system with images captured by UAV. The results showed that the proposed system yielded accuracy rate of 86.4%.",0,CHEAT
"Full-Duplex (FD) and Device-to-Device (D2D) communications have been recognized as one of the successful solutions of spectrum scarcity in 5G networks. Significant advancements in self-interference-to-power-ratio (SIPR) reduction have paved the way for FD use to double the data rates and reduce the latency. This advantage can now be exploited to optimize dynamic spectrum sharing among different radio access technologies in cognitive networks. However, protecting the primary user communication has been a challenging problem in such coexistence. In this paper, we provide an abstract level analysis of protecting primary users reception based on secondary users FD enabled communication. We also propose optimal mode selection (Half-duplex, Full-duplex, or silent) for secondary D2D users depending on its impact on primary users. Our analysis presents the significant advantage of D2D mode selection in terms of efficient spectrum utilization while protecting the primary user transmission, thus, leading the way for FD enabled D2D setup. Depending on the location and transmit power of D2D users, the induced aggregate interference should not violate the interference threshold of primary users. For this, we characterize the interference from D2D links and derive the probability for successful D2D users for half-duplex and full-duplex modes. The analyses are further supported by theoretical and extensive simulation results.",0,CHEAT
"A fast time-delay estimator for linear frequency modulation signal is proposed. The new estimator, named by frFt-TELS, searches the maximal bin of fractional Fourier transform (frFt) as a coarse estimation. Then Taylor expansion of theoretical frFt power spectrum around the coarse estimation is deduced. Least squares approximation between the theoretical frFt power spectrum and the frFt power spectrum of the given sample data is applied to get the fine estimation. Simulations demonstrated that frFt-TELS approaches the performance of traditional estimator with less computational complexity.",0,CHEAT
"We propose a Three-Player Generative Adversarial Network to improve classification networks. In addition to the game played between the discriminator and generator, a competition is introduced between the generator and the classifier. The generator's objective is to synthesize samples that are both realistic and hard to label for the classifier. Even though we make no assumptions on the type of augmentations to learn, we find that the model is able to synthesize realistically looking examples that are hard for the classification model. Furthermore, the classifier becomes more robust when trained on these difficult samples. The method is evaluated on a public dataset for traffic sign recognition.",0,CHEAT
"There are many onomatopoeias in Japanese language. Using onomatopoeias, Japanese people can communicate their own sense and image to others directly. Onomatopoeias have sound symbolism, so that the people who are familiar with Japanese can think metaphorically the image of onomatopoeias even if they are newly coined words for the people. However it is not easy for people who have different backgrounds from Japanese, to think metaphorically the meaning of semantic usage of Japanese onomatopoeias. To solve this problem, we have paid attention to phonological features and acoustic features of onomatopoeias. So far we have attempted to automatically classify some onomatopoeias into appropriate semantic usage categories by using these features. This paper adopted mimetic words regarding ""human action"" as example of test data for autoclassification. We investigated what features are useful among the phonological or acoustic features to classify the mimetic words.",0,CHEAT
"Person re-identification is a technique that search the given target in the video surveillance network. This technique has been widely applied to security and surveillance system, and also become a research hotspot in computer vision. Person re-identification has been challenging due to the large number of cameras in the network and variation in camera angles, illumination, occlusion and poses. In this paper, we proposed a person re-id approach that can resist occlusions and variations based on a human pose guided convolution neural network framework with joint loss functions. We extract local features from body parts localized by landmarks, merge it with global features to learn the similarity metric. Identification loss and pose-constrained triplet loss function are jointly employed to train the model. Our approach outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale datasets, with an accuracy of 83.31%, 86.1% and 72.6% on Cuhk03, Market1501 and Duke MTMC-reID respectively.",0,CHEAT
"A large number of mobile multimedia terminals are prominent features of smart cities. Device-to-device (D2D) communication takes advantage of the limited bandwidth resources of cellular networks to accommodate more mobile devices. However, when D2D pairs reuse cellular users channels, serious interference leads to energy consumption, which dissatisfies the requirements of green communication. This paper focuses on energy efficiency maximization of D2D communication under the constraints of both D2D pairs and cellular users quality of service. The formulated resource allocation problem is NP-hard, which is usually difficult to solve within polynomial time. To make the problem easy to handle, we divide it into power control and channel allocation sub-problems. In particular, we propose a power control algorithm based on the Lambert W function to maximize the energy efficiency of a single D2D pair. The preference values of D2D pairs and cellular users are calculated using the power control results, respectively. A channel allocation scheme based on the Gale-Shapley algorithm utilizes preference values to match two sides, which aims at maximizing the signal to interference plus noise ratio of cellular users and the energy efficiency of D2D pairs. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm could not only guarantee the transmission rate of cellular users but also improve the system and D2D pairs energy efficiency.",0,CHEAT
"Trends in processor and system architecture, driven by power and complexity, point super-computing landscape toward very high and heterogeneous core count designs. As the number of cores inevitably increase traditional ways of performing large scale computations will also need to evolve from legacy models like OpenMP & MPI. However, such models are very much wedded to a control-flow vision of parallel programs, making it difficult to express asynchrony in programs. To address these challenges, codelet model was developed which is fine-grained, event-driven asynchronous program execution model. In-spite of its initial design goals, the Codelet model is rife with opportunities for further improvements to provide high-performance for both data and control regular applications. The major inspiration behind this work is to leverage the decades of research done to exploit instruction level parallelism (ILP) for the machine instructions inside codelet while build upon the dataflow software pipelining principals at codelet graph level to further enhance performance. In this paper, we propose hardware assisted extensions to the original codelet program execution model in order to implement efficient dataflow software pipelining and extend capabilities of the codelet model. This hardware-software co-design focuses on efficient implementation of data FIFO buffers leveraging proposed optimizations like - FIFO ring buffers and multiple-head FIFO buffers and single owner FIFO buffers to further exploit advantages of dataflow software pipelining. The wide range of scientific, machine learning and specially streaming applications should be able to take advantage of techniques proposed in this paper. Identifying these kernels and bench-marking them are the next anticipated steps for us.",0,CHEAT
"The first generation of IoT was developed and deployed all over the world by connecting devices with common functionalities that were not sufficiently efficient or reliable for use in dynamic situations that require adaptive solutions. However, these fundamental IoT functions and services mainly targeted stable environments; there is consequently a strong need for the next generation of IoT services to be smarter, faster, and more reliable. We believe that the hyper-connected IoT ecosystem on fog platforms with contextual AI technologies is a promising solution. In this work, we introduce the EiF, a flexible fog computing framework that runs on IoT gateways with adaptive AI services fostered on the cloud. Our approach can be viewed as an integration of three emerging technologies, namely IoT, fog, and AI. Generally, EiF virtualizes an IoT service layer platform for fog nodes, and provides functions to manage and orchestrate various fog nodes; upon service virtualization and orchestration, AI services are fostered within both the federated cloud and distributed edge side and are deployed on fog nodes. We demonstrate the feasibility of EiF via the example of intelligent traffic flow monitoring and management.",0,CHEAT
"The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to address important challenges in our environment, industries, cities, homes and society by collecting, integrating and analysing data from potentially millions of sensors and other internet-connected devices. In this paper we propose a novel IoT-based solution that provides real-time detection of hydrocarbon pollution that can be generated by retail fuel outlets (which are also referred to as service or filling stations). Our solution includes a low-cost but highly accurate fibre optic sensor that can detect hydrocarbons in ground water and can be easily deployed in existing monitoring wells. These hydrocarbon sensors are a key part of an IoT sensor data collection and analysis platform that utilises commercially available sensor nodes to communicate via low power networks (e.g. LORA) to collect and analyse hydrocarbon pollution data in the cloud. This novel IoT platform that combines hydrocarbon sensing with cloud-based data analysis to produce continuously updated hydrocarbon pollution maps and alerts can detect and report hydrocarbon pollution in real-time. The platform could potentially collect hydrocarbon pollution levels from millions of such sensors deployed in thousands of service stations around the world and automatically analyse such data in the cloud to produce continuously and instantaneously updated hydrocarbon pollution maps and related alerts for individual service stations, corporate chains and environmental monitoring agencies.",0,CHEAT
"With Von-Neumann computing struggling to match the energy-efficiency of biological systems, there is pressing need to explore alternative computing models. Recent experimental studies have revealed that Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) is promising alternative for DRAM. Resistive crossbar arrays possess many promising features that can not only enable high-density and low-power storage but also non Von-Neumann compute models. Most recent works focus on dot product operation with RRAM crossbar arrays, and therefore are not flexible to implement various logical functions. We propose a low-power dynamic computing in memory system which can implement various functions in Sum of Product (SOP) form in RRAM crossbar array architecture. We evaluate the proposed technique by performing simulation over wide range of MCNC benchmarks.

"Distribution system state estimation (DSSE) has recently been tested and experimentally deployed in some practical distribution networks. Distinct features of distribution systems, such as diverse and unsymmetrical configurations as well as limited real-time measurements, prohibit the direct application of mature state estimation methods for transmission systems. Targeting at three-phase four-conductor configured unsymmetrical medium-voltage distribution systems (MDS) with neutral conductors and ground resistances, this paper proposes a weighted least square-based DSSE approach, in which voltages are chosen as state variables and load pseudo measurements of low-voltage distribution systems (LDS) are considered to compensate insufficient real-time measurements in MDS. Both rectangular and polar coordinates are studied, and voltage variables of neutrals and zero-injection phases are eliminated to reduce the scale of the DSSE problem. Moreover, in order to enhance the load pseudo measurement accuracy of LDSs, a clustering and partial least square regression-based load estimation model is proposed to leverage the real-time communication ability of smart meters. Case studies on a modified IEEE 123-bus distribution system with actual smart meter data illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",0,CHEAT
"An accurate recognition of a dimensional variation pattern is very important for producing high-quality body-in-white (BIW). The wide application of optical coordination measurement machines (OCMM) in vehicle factory provided massive online dimensional data for the variation pattern recognition. However, the massive serially correlated or autocorrelated and 100% measurement data generated from the OCMM challenge the traditional statistical process control (SPC) technology and the common variation recognition approaches.

"This paper considers the problem of face sketch synthesis in the wild, which transforms a face photo into a face sketch. Face sketch synthesis is widely applied in law enforcement as well as digital entertainment fields. However, the existing methods either focus on hand-crafted techniques where prior human experience is relied on or adopt deep learning techniques as an end-to-end framework, where facial details cannot be well represented. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for face sketch synthesis in the wild via a deep patch representation-based probabilistic graphical model (DeepPGM). A Siamese network is constructed to extract deep patch representation from a raw facial patch, where the representative detail information for robust face sketch synthesis can be exploited. The generated deep patch representation and facial image patches are then optimally combined through a probabilistic graphical model. The proposed DeepPGM approach not only outperforms the state-of-the-art on public face sketch datasets but also can cope with forensic photos in the wild conditions, including varying lightings, poses, occlusions, skin colors, and ethnic origins. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by extensive experiments on two public face sketch datasets and real-world forensic photos in the wild.",0,CHEAT
"With the introduction of autoscaling, clouds have strengthened their position as self-adaptive systems. Nevertheless, the reactive nature of the existing autoscaling solutions provided by major Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud services providers (CSP) heavily limits the ability of cloud applications for self-adaptation. The major reason of such limitations is the necessity for the manual configuration of the autoscaling rules. With the evolution of monitoring systems, it became possible to employ the data-driven approaches to derive the parameters of scaling rules in order to enable the autoscaling in advance, i.e. the predictive autoscaling. The change in the amount of requests to microservices could be considered as a reason to adapt the virtual infrastructure underlying the cloud application. By forecasting the amount of requests to cloud application, it is possible to estimate the upcoming demand to replicate the microservices in advance. Hence, anticipation of the demand on the cloud application helps to evolve its self-adaptive properties. In the scope of the paper, the authors have tested various extrapolation models on the real anonymized requests time series data for 261 microservices provided by the industry partner Instana. The tested models are: various seasonal ARIMA models with GARCH modifications and outliers detection, exponential smoothing models, singular spectrum analysis (SSA), support vector regression (SVR), and simple linear regression. In order to evaluate the accuracy of these models, an interval score was used. The time required to fit and use each model was also evaluated. Comparative results of this research and the classification of forecasting models based on the interval accuracy score and model fitting time are provided in the paper. The study provides an approach to evaluate the quality of forecasting models to be used for self-adapting cloud applications and virtual infrastructure.",0,CHEAT
"When using standard learning techniques for uncertainty approximation, persistently exciting inputs are necessary in order to achieve good parameter estimation. It has been shown in recent years that, through concurrent learning (CL), it is possible to achieve better learning without requiring persistency of excitation. We define good learning here by how well an uncertainty can be reconstructed given the estimated parameters. Most studies concerning CL have however been done in the continuous-time (CT) framework. While working with discrete-time (DT) structured uncertainties, we have shown in an earlier study that the concept of CL could be used to solve the parameter identification problem granted, much like in the CT domain, a less restrictive condition compared to that of persistency of excitation is verified. This paper furthers our fundamental study of CL in the DT framework while drawing comparisons with the traditional but fundamental gradient descent technique. As a main contribution, via formal derivations, we present a generalized gradient-based CL motivated DT algorithm for online approximation of both DT structured and unstructured uncertainties. Numerical simulations are provided to show how well the designed algorithm leverages memory usage to achieve better learning.",0,CHEAT
"Since deep neural networks (DNNs) are very intensive in terms of memory, compressing them with weight sharing is known to be an effective technique to deploy the networks on embedded systems with limited on-chip memory capacity, resulting in a considerable saving of energy consumption. However, the extreme compression sacrifices the accuracy of DNNs. In this context, this work introduces two unique optimization problems and proposes solutions for DNNs with “unfitted compression” to maintain the accuracy, in which all distinct weights of the compressed DNNs could not be entirely contained in on-chip memory. Precisely, given an access sequence of weights, (1) the first problem is to arrange the weights in off-chip memory, so that the number of memory accesses to the off-chip memory (equivalently the energy consumed by the accesses) be minimized, and (2) the second problem is to devise a strategy of selecting a weight block in on-chip memory for replacement when a block miss occurs, with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumed by the off-chip memory accesses and the overhead of scanning indexes for block replacement. Through experiments with the model of compressed AlexNet, it is shown that our solutions are able to reduce the total energy consumption of the off-chip memory accesses including the scanning overhead by 34.2% on average over the use of unoptimized memory layout and LRU replacement scheme.",0,CHEAT

Then, a quality measure for each line is computed, integrating sensor coherence, availability as well as temporal continuity.

"Automated Tongue Diagnosis (ATD) is a growing research field in recent years due to global demand of personal health care. Automated tongue segmentation is the fundamental technology for automated tongue diagnosis. It is significant to find an efficient and accurate tongue segmentation algorithm for mobile and embedded devices. However, researches in this field are inadequate. Existing methods are either not efficient or not accurate enough. Our paper first addresses these problems by presenting a class of efficient cascaded CNN models for tongue detection and segmentation, which is both lightweight and accurate compared with other high-performance algorithms. Furthermore, a new annotation method is proposed to reduce the workload of establishing a tongue segmentation database.",0,CHEAT
"The cloud data centers are going through an unprecedented growth from past few years. In an era of real-time video streaming, on-demand gaming, door-step e-commerce services, and highly inter-connected social networks, cost-effective service models, adaptive resources provisioning and upfront applications availability contribute significantly towards such a stellar growth. However, there are many challenges that must be addressed in a systematic manner to meet the requirements of increasingly demanding current and upcoming applications of the cloud computing paradigm. Optimum resources management, instant response time, interoperability among a diverse set of emerging technologies and innovative applications are a few of these challenges. On the other hand, the recent trend in softwarization of networks, particularly enabled by network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN) principles, provides immense opportunities to better utilize the network resources by programmable abstractions with an efficient control and management techniques. Furthermore, machine learning based solutions are gaining prominence in resource optimization problems and autonomous systems. Therefore, in this paper, we strive to connect the dots by state-of-the-art methodologies in networking and machine learning domains and utilize these developments to grapple with the challenges of the cloud-based systems. We propose DeepSDN, an SDN-based solution that harnesses existing machine learning techniques to move a step closer towards self-driving networks. The comparative results obtained from an experimental testbed corroborates effectiveness of our approach and suggest a way forward towards autonomous network management.",0,CHEAT
"The main challenges of the anatomical segmentation of automated whole breast ultrasound (AWBUS) image are shadow effect, blurred boundary, low contrast and large target. To tackle them, a novel and effective framework named AttentionNet is developed via self-attention mechanism during both feature extraction and up-sampling phase. Specifically, features are firstly extracted based on ResNeXt-50 to explore the information of intra-channels. With the goal of extracting features and utilizing channel information effectively, a module named spatial attention refinement (SAR) is devised using the basic ResNeXt-50 module (a.k.a., ResNeXt-SAR). Then, a weighted up-sampling block (WUB) module for precise pixel localization is designed by introducing high-level semantic concept during up-sampling phase, playing an important role in guiding the low-level features by the category information. The extensive experiments are conducted on AWBUS image for multi-class image segmentation. Our proposed AttentionNet achieves the superior results over the state-of-the-art approaches and may help to assist the calculation of breast density.",0,CHEAT
"Analog-to-Information Converter (AIC) is the physical implementation of Compressed Sensing (CS) systems to digitize signals directly from the analog domain. Due to non-idealities of components AIC hardware needs a calibration step to adjust parameters before its utilization. In this paper, we consider a theoretical linear model of an AIC architecture composed by parallel channels that suffers from synchronization problems between the input signal and the internal signals used to perform the measurement. Using a radar inspired technique we propose a method to estimate the delay between these signals. Obtained results show the accuracy of the proposed method and its potential to be used in AIC calibration techniques.",0,CHEAT
"Endoscopy is a routine imaging technique used for both diagnosis and minimally invasive surgical treatment. While the endoscopy video contains a wealth of information, tools to capture this information for the purpose of clinical reporting are rather poor. In date, endoscopists do not have any access to tools that enable them to browse the video data in an efficient and user friendly manner. Fast and reliable video retrieval methods could for example, allow them to review data from previous exams and therefore improve their ability to monitor disease progression. Deep learning provides new avenues of compressing and indexing video in an extremely efficient manner. In this study, we propose to use an autoencoder for efficient video compression and fast retrieval of video images. To boost the accuracy of video image retrieval and to address data variability like multi-modality and view-point changes, we propose the integration of a Siamese network. We demonstrate that our approach is competitive in retrieving images from 3 large scale videos of 3 different patients obtained against the query samples of their previous diagnosis. Quantitative validation shows that the combined approach yield an overall improvement of 5% and 8% over classical and variational autoencoders, respectively.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, a programmable dynamic simulation interface (PDSI)-based online fault configuration approach of network simulation is proposed to dynamically set link fault as well as route fault in the case of joint power grid simulation. The proposed approach allows the user to dynamically configure the fault situations of communication network via a graphical user interface (GUI) during the simulation process. When QualNet receives the configuration messages from GUI, it will parse the messages and push the corresponding events into the event queue to close the link port or rewriting the routing tables, which is utilized to formulate the link fault or the route fault. Experiment results demonstrate that based on the proposed approach the fault configuration of communication network can be successfully performed with an acceptable compromise at interface interaction delay.",0,CHEAT
"A class of the preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics has recently been proven to be globally convergent, meaning that the dynamics always converges to a unique equilibrium whose location only depends on the values of the model parameters (but not the initial state of the dynamics). In this paper, we unify the aforementioned class of preventive and reactive cyber defense dynamics models and the closely related class of N-intertwined epidemic models into a single framework. We prove that the unified dynamics is still globally convergent under some mild conditions, which are naturally satisfied by the two specific classes of dynamics models mentioned above and are inevitable when analyzing a more general framework. We also characterize the convergence speed of the unified dynamics. As a corollary, we obtain that the N-intertwined epidemic model and its extension are globally convergent, together with a full characterization on their convergence speed, which is only partially addressed in the literature.",0,CHEAT
"The Internet of symmetric traffic flows between networks and a hierarchical topology, has long given way to one with a significantly asymmteric traffic flows and a flatter topology. The Internet topology of today may be characterised as having three key types of networks-content providers, user access providers, and transit providers. Further, in this Internet, best-effort routing of centrally stored content using distributed protocols has been seen to be inadequate to provide a suitably reliable transport service to provide the requisite quality of service to the end user. Two important developments to mitigate this gap in the capability of the Internet and the needs of modern content are the following. (1) Proliferation of content distribution networks (2) direct peering between content networks and ISPs. In this paper we analyze the economics of such interconnections. Using microeconomic models from industrial organization literature, we first develop the conditions for a content provider to connect directly to a service provider. Further, when such a direct link is indeed sought, we analyze the quality of the link vis-a-vis the default option of using a transit service. We then analyze the content provider market coverage by the content distribution networks. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results on the objectives sought by net neutrality regimes.",0,CHEAT
"Recently, visible light communication (VLC) networks have emerged as a promising alternative for indoor data access, due to high data rate, low implementation cost, and immunity to radio frequency (RF) interference. However, the co-existence of VLC with the RF access points as well as the dependence of VLC to room illumination compel both technologies to work in parallel and thus, to form a hybrid heterogeneous VLC/RF network. This network offers the advantages of both technologies, namely increased capacity and ubiquitous coverage. Furthermore, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a very promising candidate technique for the next generation of wireless networks, mainly due to its increased spectrum efficiency compared to orthogonal access schemes. However, the optimal user grouping in NOMA is a combinatorial NP-complete problem, which calls for low complexity techniques. To this end, in this paper, we propose the use of coalitional game theory, where the users served by the same access point (VLC or RF) form a single coalition, while the users can switch through coalitions based on their payoff. A novel utility function is proposed that takes into account the peculiarities of the NOMA hybrid VLC/RF network. Finally, a coalition formation algorithm is presented as well as an efficient power allocation policy. Computer simulations validate the presented analysis and reveal the effectiveness of the proposed user grouping scheme compared to an opportunistic approach.",0,CHEAT
"Voice-over IP (VoIP) technology is a kind of digital transmission technology based on IP network. It is one of the important methods to use voice service in VoIP as steganographic carrier to ensure secure transmission. However, the traditional steganographic code has some problems, such as low embedding efficiency and weak concealment, which cannot meet the requirements of VoIP streaming media information hiding for the security of secret information. Therefore, a steganographic algorithm combining F5 and simplified wet paper code (SWPC) algorithm is proposed. The main idea is to embed secret messages in each row of the carrier matrix using the F5 algorithm, and then the SWPC algorithm is used to embed the columns according to the wet and dry characteristics of the wet paper code without affecting the results before row embedding. We use the VoIP streams encoded by the ITU-T G.729a codec as a carrier to verify the proposed scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve relatively better IP speech data steganographic transparency and that it can outperform F5-WPC and SWPC approaches.",0,CHEAT
"Integrated circuit (IC) camouflaging is a promising defense against so-called IC extraction attacks that seek to reverse engineer the netlist of a packaged IC using delayering and imaging techniques. Camouflaging works by hiding the Boolean functionality of selected gates in the netlist from reverse engineering, albeit at the cost of increased gate area and power. The intuitive security claim then is that the attacker cannot infer the netlist's exact Boolean functionality. This paper describes a powerful class of attacks on IC camouflaging referred to as SAT attacks; the attacks use the input/output (I/O) behavior of a functional camouflaged IC along with the Boolean satisfiability (SAT)-based inference to reverse the Boolean functionalities of camouflaged gates. The SAT attack is rooted in a foundational complexity theory mindset and is shown to defeat defenses that previously claimed to secure against even the most determined adversaries. This paper then highlights the subsequent impact of the SAT attack in terms of new SAT-resilient defenses that emerged, their vulnerability to enhancements of the SAT attack, and implications of the attack on provably secure defense mechanisms.",0,CHEAT
"The booming of High Definition (HD) and UltraHD (UHD) videos in the last decade has greatly promoted the use of video display on diversified terminals such as TV, tablets and smartphones. To present more video contents with high quality to users, it is imperative to assess the visual quality of videos. The approach denoted as Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has become an appealing problem to researchers. In this work, we take the video contents into consideration besides of media format and pixel quality. This paper utilizes four measures, picture resolution, bitrates, Spatial Information (SI) and Temporal Information (TI), to represent the visual quality in four separate dimensions. Then, a subjective database is constructed to train a neural network that is capable of scaling content-aware video qualities. Experiments have shown that our method is superior to human observers in terms of correlations to Mean Opinion Score (MOS) values.",0,CHEAT
"This paper investigates a grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system where massive number of users wake up and send data right away without performing a grant-based initial access procedure. Since no scheduling grant is used in this system, the base station (BS) does not know which user is transmitting on each resource. Also, due to the lack of an uplink (UL) timing control process, multiple user's signals are asynchronously received at the BS. This causes asynchronous interference, or multiuser inter-carrier and inter-symbol interference. We propose two ideas to address these two problems. We first propose an auxiliary preamble structure to successfully detect the user activity, even in the presence of a massive number of users. We, then, propose a modification to the interleave-division multiple access (IDMA) receiver to mitigate asynchronous interference. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the preamble detection performance and BER performance compared to the conventional schemes. Furthermore, we show that the proposed grant-free NOMA system can achieve much better performance than the grant-based NOMA system in terms of transmission time and signaling overhead.",0,CHEAT
"The development of Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET) has brought many conveniences to human beings, but also brings a very prominent security problem. The traditional solution to the security problem is based on centralized approach which requires a trusted central entity which exists a single point of failure problem. Moreover, there is no approach of technical level to ensure security of data. Therefore, this paper proposes a security architecture of VANET based on blockchain and mobile edge computing. The architecture includes three layers, namely perception layer, edge computing layer and service layer. The perception layer ensures the security of VANET data in the transmission process through the blockchain technology. The edge computing layer provides computing resources and edge cloud services to the perception layer. The service layer uses the combination of traditional cloud storage and blockchain to ensure the security of data.",0,CHEAT
"This article describes a specially developed system for automatic control of temperature in the weld area during lap welding.

"Annotation of the perceived emotion of a music piece is required for an automatic music emotion recognition system. Most music emotion datasets are developed for Western pop songs. The problem is that a music emotion recognizer trained on such datasets may not work well for non-Western pop songs due to the differences in acoustic characteristics and emotion perception that are inherent to cultural background. The problem was also found in cross-cultural and cross-dataset studies; however, little has been done to learn how to adapt a model pre-trained on a source music genre to a target music genre of interest. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by an unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation method. It employs neural network models to make the target music indistinguishable from the source music in a learned feature representation space. Because emotion perception is multifaceted, three types of input feature representations related to timbre, pitch, and rhythm are considered for performance evaluation. The results show that the proposed method effectively improves the prediction of the valence of Chinese pop songs from a model trained for Western pop songs.",0,CHEAT
"Advances in automated face analysis have made possible webcam-based assessment of viewer emotion during presentation of commercials and other video content. A key assumption of this technology is that viewer emotion is in response to the media. Is that assumption warranted? Because viewer attention is seldom assessed, emotional responses could result from other sources, such as talking to a friend, enjoying a meal, or attending to a pet. We developed a CNN-LSTM approach that detects attention and nonattention to commercials using webcam and mobile devices in settings of viewer's choice. Because cultural variation in viewer response is likely, we included participants from both Western and Eastern countries. Participants were 28,911 adults (ages 18 to 69 years) in Europe, USA, Russia, and China. A total of 15,543 sessions (ca. 6.5 million video frames) was analyzed. Accuracy was quantified using a variety of metrics. Our approach outperformed baseline and achieved moderate to high accuracy that approached that of human annotators.",0,CHEAT
"Identification and classification of Power Quality (PQ) events have been a subject of recent interest for researchers from the point of view of initiating suitable control actions in Distributed Generation Systems (DGs) for achieving improved performance. This requires carrying out a detailed analysis of the various characteristics of real time electrical signals through a set of signal processing techniques. In this context, two major parameters are considered to arrive at suitable control actions needed for monitoring and control of DGs. These parameters include PQ distortions due to environmental factors, such as change in wind speed and solar irradiations. Signal features are extracted using S-Transform while signal-classification is done by Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) technique. A 17-bus test system is modeled using the open source software, Open Distribution System Simulator (OpenDSS). LS-SVM and S-Transform are implemented using MatLab. Smart converter control is realized with inputs received from signal classifier, so as to initiate proper grid-support functions.",0,CHEAT

"Falls are a primary accident for elderly people living independently. Obviously, timely and accurate fall detection is critical to reduce the injuries and avoid the loss of life. In order to improve existing smartphone-based fall detection systems, this paper investigates the features of triaxial acceleration values acquired from built-in accelerometers of a smartphone, identifies crucial thresholds of the falls and non-falls, and then proposes an enhanced threshold-based fall detection approach, which could not only distinguish fall events from the most of daily activities (including walking, running, and sitting down), but also support four directions (forward, backward, left lateral, and right lateral) of the falls. In addition, once a falling accident is identified, the user position would be instantaneously transmitted to an emergency center in order to have timely medical assistance. As a consequence, experimental results show the feasibility of our enhanced approach with accuracy and detection rates of 99.38% and 96%, respectively, while a set of 650 test activities including 11 different kinds of daily activities are performed.",0,CHEAT
"Objective: In this paper, a framework to visualize and model internal fixation plates is presented for computer-aided personalized and minimally invasive curved bone fracture surgery. Methods: We focus on personalized reverse reconstruction of the bone fracture plate based on three-dimensional (3-D) mesh models obtained from a 3-D optical scanner. The steps of the method are as follows. First, principal component analysis and the K-means method are used to reconstruct a Bezier curve (ridge line) of broken bones. Second, based on the geometric shape of the curved broken bones, a capsule projection model of the broken bones is proposed to obtain the feature information of the broken bone sections. Third, the ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS) method is utilized for preregistration (rough registration). Fourth, a regional self-growth strategy is designed to extract the cross-section points. Fifth, the iterative closest point method is applied for the accurate registration of the fracture surface models. Finally, a personalized internal fixation plate model is reconstructed based on several user points. Results: The internal fixation plate model can be reconstructed according to the patient's bone parameters. Conclusion: Clinicians can use this framework to obtain personalized and accurate internal fixation plate models that effectively represent the broken bones of patients. Via X-ray navigation, the personalized forged plate can be fixed on the target area through a small incision. Significance: This framework provides a reasonable and practicable technical approach for computer-aided minimally invasive curved bone fracture surgery.",0,CHEAT
"We describe a distributed framework for resource sharing problems that we face in communications, microeconomics and various networking applications. In particular, we consider a hierarchical multi-layer decomposition for network utility maximization (NUM), where functionalities are assigned to different layers. The proposed methodology creates solutions having central management and distributed computations. The technique aims to respond to the dynamics of the network by decreasing the communication cost, while shifting more computational load to the edges of the network. The main contribution of this work is the provision of a detailed analysis under the assumption that the network changes are in the same time-scale with the convergence time of the algorithms used for local computations. For this scenario, assuming strong concavity and smoothness of the users' objective functions, we present convergence rates for each layer.",0,CHEAT
"Cloud computing is an Internet-based service which provides shared virtual resource and data to accomplish certain computation. In order for the servers to have sufficient resources when the request arrives, as well as save server resources as much as possible, we propose a prediction-based server capacity planning and dynamic scheduling algorithm. There are mainly three steps in our capacity planning algorithm. The first step characterizes the given data on several indices and then present an effective model in order to predict the oncoming demands in the near future. The second step generates the workload of servers combined with the predicted demands and then make capacity planning based on this workload. Thus it's obvious that the effectiveness of capacity planning depends on the accuracy of prediction to a great extent. Finally, a demand prediction based strategy on workload allocation is brought out. A dynamic resource allocation strategy is given to ensure the quality of service at any moment in future meanwhile taking energy consumption into consideration. The results of the experiment show that the required server number decreases by 33% after the prediction-based capacity planning applying on server scheduling.",0,CHEAT
"Increasing longevity remains one of the open challenges for Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technology. We envision a health-conscious advanced battery management system, which implements monitoring and control algorithms that increase battery lifetime while maintaining performance. For such algorithms, real-time battery capacity estimates are crucial. In this paper, we present an online capacity estimation scheme for Li-ion batteries. The key novelty lies in: 1) leveraging thermal dynamics to estimate battery capacity and 2) developing a hierarchical estimation algorithm with provable convergence properties. The algorithm consists of two stages working in cascade. The first stage estimates battery core temperature and heat generation based on a two-state thermal model, and the second stage receives the core temperature and heat generation estimation to estimate state-of-charge and capacity. Results from numerical simulations and experimental data illustrate the performance of the proposed capacity estimation scheme.",0,CHEAT
"This paper explores the application of machine learning techniques in finance to predict if a publicly-traded firm will issue a Seasoned Equity Offering (SEO) by analyzing the firm's 10-Q filing documents with Security and Exchange Commissions (SEC). Specifically, using the information content in the Management Discussion and Analysis section (MD&A) of 10-Q filings, we train five different algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Classification (SVC), Multinomial Naïve Bayes (NB), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF). Two types of features, unigrams and phrases are considered. Term frequency-inverse document (TF-IDF) scores are used as independent variables in these models. Experimental results show that the accuracy of phrases-only models has a range of 0-2% improvement for LR, NB, and RF compared with unigrams-only models. The accuracy of phrase-only model for SVC is close to that of unigrams-only model. The 74.53% accuracy of unigrams-only model for SVC classifier performs the best among all tested classifiers. The precision of all models varies between 60% and 75%, while the recall varies between 55% and 85%. Further, we tune model parameters of one linear model (LR) and one non-linear model (RF) to see how these parameters will impact the models' performance. Finally, we apply RF to find the most important features on prediction and find that ""merger"" is the most important feature in both unigrams-only model and phrases-only model.

"Detecting anomalous behavior in wireless spectrum is a demanding task due to the sheer complexity of the electromagnetic spectrum use. Wireless spectrum anomalies can take a wide range of forms from the presence of an unwanted signal in a licensed band to the absence of an expected signal, which makes manual labeling of anomalies difficult and suboptimal. We present, Spectrum Anomaly Detector with Interpretable FEatures (SAIFE), an Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) based anomaly detector for wireless spectrum anomaly detection using Power Spectral Density (PSD) data which achieves good anomaly detection and localization in an unsupervised setting.

Along with anomaly detection the model exhibits promising results for lossy PSD data compression up to 120X and semi-supervised signal classification accuracy close to 100% on three datasets just using 20% labeled samples. Finally the model is tested on data from one of the distributed Electrosense sensors over a long term of 500 hours showing its anomaly detection capabilities.",0,CHEAT

"These days mobile phones are having advanced onboard sensors embedded in it which makes connecting and computing much easier. This has led to realizing novel application paradigms such as crowd sensing and crowd computing. Crowd sensing relies on the sensing capabilities of the mobile devices as well as its communication efficiency to send collected sensed data to the cloud for further processing. On the other hand, mobile crowd computing is an amalgamation of the machine and human intelligence to achieve a given set of tasks in a distributed manner. Thus, crowd computing utilizes the computation and communication capability of the devices. Here in our work, we have come up with a novel approach integrating these two paradigms in a framework that have addressed both the issues of mobile sensing and crowd computing at the same time and utilized the ability of the crowd to solve problems without involving cloud servers in the backend.

"Characterization of collagen deposition in immunostained images is relevant to various pathological conditions, particularly in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Accurate segmentation of these collagens and extracting representative features of underlying diseases are important steps to achieve quantitative diagnosis. While a first order statistic derived from the segmented collagens can be useful in representing pathological evolutions at different timepoints, it fails to capture morphological changes and spatial arrangements. In this work, we demonstrate a complete pipeline for extracting key histopathology features representing underlying disease progression from histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs) via integration of deep learning and graph theory. A convolutional neural network is trained and utilized for histopathological WSI segmentation. Parallel processing is applied to convert 100K ~ 150K segmented collagen fibrils into a single collective attributed relational graph, and graph theory is applied to extract topological and relational information from the collagenous framework. Results are in good agreement with the expected pathogenicity induced by collagen deposition, highlighting potentials in clinical applications for analyzing various meshwork-structures in whole-slide histology images.",0,CHEAT
"Firewalls as an approved and highly deployed security mechanism have an important role in setting up reliable security policies to ensure the protection of private and critical systems and infrastructures. While a firewall is considered as an essential node in Information Systems (IS) security and represents the backbone of security solutions, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the efficiency of its configuration and the reliability and coherence of its filtering policy. Enhancing the efficiency of access control solutions via improving the quality and the capacity of firewalls attracted several researchers which led to several generations of firewall technologies. In this context, we introduce the novel concept of FW-TR firewall that integrates a trust-risk assessment approach in firewall solutions. Evaluating and involving the trust-risk associated to the filtering rules and policy in a firewall solution helps primary in: (i) strengthening the quality of the firewall filtering service; (ii) discovering firewall misconfigurations; (iii) analyzing firewall rules for anomalies detection; and (iv) changing the firewall behavior facing critical and malicious scenarios.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and while scientists know that AD involves progressive neuronal cell loss, the reason why this occurs is still not known. As AD exerts a systems-level impact on the brain, therefore the brain structural connectome, derived from whole-brain tractography using diffusion-weighted MRI, has the potential to study the systems-level changes associated with the AD progression. Traditionally, structural connectome is reconstructed based on one single tractography algorithm and commonly involves the comparison of summary graph-theoretical metrics, which could be biased and also discard important informative graph structure. In this paper, we proposed to study the AD effect on brain structural connectome using a multi-view approach.

We focused on a near-field reconstruction technique that estimates the power density in close proximity to a wireless communication device using the results of electric field measurement at a plane several wavelengths away from the device. In this paper, the reconstruction technique was first validated by comparing the results evaluated using this technique with those obtained by computational simulation for the case of a standard horn antenna. Second, the reconstruction errors of the technique were assessed using ten planar array antennas at frequencies from 15 to 100 GHz. Reconstruction errors no larger than 0.35 dB were obtained for the maximum spatially averaged power density at a separation distance of over 0.15λ from the antennas using an averaging area of λ2 or larger, where λ denotes the wavelength. Finally, the requirement for electric field measurement was also examined, where the combined error for the compliance assessment of the power density was suggested for an actual testing scenario. These results support the standardization of compliance assessment techniques for wireless communication devices operating above 6 GHz, which are expected to be introduced in the near future.",0,CHEAT
"In online apparel market, there is a high return rate mainly due to the size mismatches. As a solution, Virtual garment technologies have been introduced for finding apparels with precise fit whereas most of these technologies are categorized under commercial 3D applications. Therefore, suitability of these 3D applications to check the fitness of selected garment item to a particular user in online marketplace is less due to network latency issues, the need of high user intervention and computational power albeit to the ability of providing highly accurate fitness for a selected garment. Within this paper, a lightweight solution is presented which assists the decision making process of end users in the online market to select perfectly fitted garment by considering human body measurements and garment measurements. The suggested fitting model is consolidated with 2D patterns of human body and finished garments which has the ability of identifying the fitness and manifesting it using seven predefined areas along with user preference and distance ease values. This research has only concerned on generating the fitting model for short sleeve men's shirts due to the limited time frame. The procedure of generating the 2D block pattern from a finished short sleeve shirt has been discerned through an experiment and standard error values which are associated with aforementioned conversion has been recognized using the experiment results. The implemented model was endeavoured on 20 participants and qualitative approaches were used to evaluate the implemented model resulting an accuracy of 81.2%. A survey was conducted to evaluate the visualization of the system output, and received 76% positive responses",0,CHEAT

"Wireless sensor-actuator networks (WSANs) technology is appealing for use in the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) applications because it does not require wired infrastructure. Battery-powered wireless modules easily and inexpensively retrofit existing sensors and actuators in the industrial facilities without running cabling for communication and power. The IEEE 802.15.4-based WSANs operate at low-power and can be manufactured inexpensively, which makes them ideal where battery lifetime and costs are important. Almost, a decade of realworld deployments of WirelessHART standard has demonstrated the feasibility of using its core techniques including reliable graph routing and time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) to achieve reliable low-power wireless communication in the industrial facilities. Today, we are facing the fourth Industrial Revolution as proclaimed by political statements related to the Industry 4.0 Initiative of the German Government. There exists an emerging demand for deploying a large number of field devices in an industrial facility and connecting them through the WSAN. However, a major limitation of current WSAN standards is their limited scalability due to their centralized routing and scheduling that enhance the predictability and visibility of network operations at the cost of scalability. This paper decentralizes the network management in WirelessHART and presents the first Distributed Graph routing and autonomous Scheduling (DiGS) solution that allows the field devices to compute their own graph routes and transmission schedules. The experimental results from two physical testbeds and a simulation study shows our approaches can significantly improve the network reliability, latency, and energy efficiency under dynamics.",0,CHEAT
"Human footprint is the biometric system of the individual person. Everyone has specific footprints. It can be used instead of password-based authentication in the security system such as a user authentication for the financial transaction. The password-based system cannot verify that the person who entered the password is valid or not. Therefore the biometric system is more secure than the password-based system. For that reason, it's interesting to use footprint image in the creating of the footprint-based identification system. In this paper, the convolutional neural network training is used for deep learning classification. Convolutional neural networks are essential for deep learning and suited for image recognition.",0,CHEAT
"The increasing deployment of datacenters and cloud resources around the globe escalated by higher electricity prices advanced energy cost, cooling and communication cost, and carbon dioxide consumption. To curb such ever-increasing problem complexity, we have formulated a scientific workflow-based cost-effective paradigm based on rigorous mathematical model. Multiple techniques have been considered to increase system utilization rate within acceptable performance bounds. First, we have applied Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) approach to scale down the power consumption by cloud servers via calculating the best near-optimal frequency. Then, we have reused cloud-based VMs to execute as many scientific workflows as possible using fewer cloud servers which conserves a tremendous amount of energy cost including carbon dioxide emission consumption and electricity cost. This has been done through eliminating the overhead of sharing multiple VMs the same server's capacity. Moreover, the aforementioned objectives have been achieved without degrading the Quality of Service (QoS) specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA). However, we have simulated our heuristic using open source CloudSim and compared with algorithms such as the Rank and EARES-D. The results have showed that our paradigm model is better than other heuristics with an average energy reduction of 70%.",0,CHEAT
"In this letter, we consider the device-to-device (D2D) communication in downlink cellular networks, where the cellular user (CU) both decodes information and harvests the energy. Unlike the conventional D2D communications, we figure out that it is possible for the D2D pair to communicate without degrading the performance of the CU. Based on this observation, D2D transmit power control schemes are proposed for D2D rate maximization subject to maintaining the CU performance. In a decentralized way, the proposed power control schemes are performed at the D2D transmitter (DT) with instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of only the link between the D2D pair. For performance analysis, an asymptotic upper bound is provided on the D2D rates of the proposed schemes. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.",0,CHEAT
"Traffic congestion and occlusions are major problems nowadays in metropolitan cities which leads to an ever growing traffic accidents. Therefore, the need of traffic flux management in order to avoid these congestions, unnecessary time wastage and tragic accidents is very important. Traffic regulation by optimizing timing of traffic control signals is one of the solutions for this purpose. This paper presents a low cost camera based algorithm in order to control traffic flow on a road. The algorithm is based on mainly three steps: vehicle detection, counting and tracking. Background subtraction is used to isolate vehicles from their background, Kalman filter is used to track the vehicles and Hungarian algorithm is exploited for association of labels to the tracked vehicles. This algorithm is implemented on both daytime and night time videos acquiered from CCTV camera and IR camera. Experimental results show the efficacy of the algorithm.",0,CHEAT

"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown superior performance on a variety of artificial intelligence problems. Reducing the resource usage of DNN is critical to adding intelligence on Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Channel pruning based network compression shows effective reduction simultaneously on storage, memory and computation without specialized software on general platforms. But limited by pruning flexibility, channel pruning methods have relatively low compression rate for a given target performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that channel pruning becomes more robust to decision errors by reducing the granularity of filters. Then we propose a Decouple and Stretch (DS) scheme to enhance channel pruning. Under this scheme, each filter in a specific layer is decoupled into two small spatial-wise filters, and the spatial-wise filters are stretched into two successive convolutional layers. Our scheme obtains up to 49% improvement on compression and 35% improvement on acceleration. To further demonstrate hardware compatibility, we deploy pruned networks on the FPGA, and the network produced by Decouple and Stretch scheme is more hardware-friendly with latency reduced by 42%.",0,CHEAT
"Increasing complexity in production calls for a skilled workforce. With increasing demands on employee's qualification, also the pressure on companies to train their workforce is constantly rising. Technical knowledge in the context of managing, operating and interacting with new machines and media, so-called “digital literacy”, is thereby fundamentally desired within fast-paced changing environments. Here, the organizational learning infrastructure is next to personal variables a crucial factor, especially when it comes to knowledge generation. Due to digital transformation of work-places further development of employees receives evermore attention. In contrast to white-collar workers research on production workers is in this context widely underrepresented in current research and insights not often enough utilized. This study assesses current challenges production workers face and evaluates their work-related state of interaction with media. Furthermore, the study conveys insights into the factors which influence their learning motivations.

"Accurate classification and the effective recognition of driving styles are critical for improving control performance of the vehicle powertrain. In this research, a set of driving style classification and recognition methods is built based on the feature engineering. First, a specified road test is conducted considering the influence factors, and meanwhile, the corresponding driving data is collected, followed by a detailed evaluation of the driving styles. Then, the information entropy is applied to discretize the driving data, including the speed, acceleration, and opening degree of the accelerator pedal, and 44 feature quantities are extracted to characterize the driving style. By analyzing strong correlation and redundancy among the constructed feature quantities, the principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the dimension, and the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is leveraged to classify the driving style. The successful classification rate reaches 92.16%, which is improved by 9.81% in comparison with traditional features. Finally, a parameter identification algorithm based on the support vector machine (SVM) is applied to identify the classified driving style, and the recognition accuracy reaches 92.86%, which is improved by 7.15% in comparison with traditional features, proving the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.",0,CHEAT
"In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, due to the limited computing power of terminal equipment, edge-cloud computing is a good solution for sharing the computation resources. Terminals can offload partial computations to the edge servers for energy saving and reduce the data transmission delays since the edge servers are usually deployed near the terminal devices. However, in the existing solutions, there is still a lot of unnecessary data transmission when the data used in the offloading jobs of several terminals are related. Adding a shareable cache to the edge server and allowing different computing jobs to share the related data can further reduce the data transmission cost and job delay. In this paper, we study the computation offloading method with cached data and propose a novel cache-aware computation offloading strategy for edge-cloud computing in IoT. First, we formulize the cache-aware computation offloading location problem, our goal is to minimize the equivalent weighted response time of all jobs with computing power and cache capacity constraints. Then, we derive the global optimum solution based on transforming the problem to the transportation problem. Next, since the terminal device is difficult to obtain global status information, we propose an online computation offloading strategy, which is convenient in practical deployment. Finally, experiments show that our online offloading strategy approximates the global optimal solution and it reduces the weighted response time by about 26.13% on average compared to other competing algorithms.",0,CHEAT
"With the emergence of in-depth research of emerging technologies or 5G mobile communication technology methods, the IoT applications have been further sublimated. In this paper, the new characteristics and new challenges appearing in the current mobile edge computing are sorted out, and the latest related models and work are summarized. The important optimization models and moving models and wireless block data in mobile edge computing are analyzed and discussed. On this basis, this paper mainly designs and verifies the following three aspects of mobile edge computing. A joint optimization model of task offloading and power allocation is established, and a centralized joint optimization algorithm for task unloading and power allocation is proposed. Based on the equalization delay and the impact of energy consumption on task unloading, the algorithm can use the idle resources that can be used to distribute and unload the computing tasks. The simulation experiments show that the algorithm can not only coordinate task offloading and power allocation effectively, but also improve the balance between system delay and energy consumption. Delay-tolerable data can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process in a software-defined transport and compute node selection process. Compared with the existing scheme, the proposed method can effectively reduce system overhead, shorten data calculation execution time, improve data calculation efficiency, and ensure that the delay can tolerate data transmission arrival rate under the condition of transmission delay.",0,CHEAT

"Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) has been used as a standard post-processing procedure in many state-of-the-art speaker recognition tasks. Through maximizing the inter-speaker difference and minimizing the intra-speaker variation, LDA projects i-vectors to a lower-dimensional and more discriminative subspace. In this paper, we propose a neural network based compensation scheme(termed as deep discriminant analysis, DDA) for i-vector based speaker recognition, which shares the idea with LDA. Optimized against softmax loss and center loss at the same time, the proposed method learns a more compact and discriminative embedding space. Compared with the Gaussian distribution assumption of data and the learned linear projection in LDA, the proposed method doesn't pose any assumptions on data and can learn a non-linear projection function. Experiments are carried out on a short-duration text-independent dataset based on the SRE Corpus, noticeable performance improvement can be observed against the normal LDA or PLDA methods.",0,CHEAT
"Cloud computing and big data have risen to become the most popular technologies of the modern world. Apparently, the reason behind their immense popularity is their wide range of applicability as far as the areas of interest are concerned.

"Coil gun multistage is used to launch a projectile. To increase the velocity of the projectile can be done by adding the number of stages or the number of layers, but it can't control projectile motion. Controlling of the projectile inside the barrel is very important because for regulating the velocity of the projectile when it comes out of the end of the barrel to be as expected. This problem can be solved by a non-uniform multistage coil design. Each coil is twisted separately with the placement between coils coinciding. Multistage coil operation is designed by injecting the current on the coil simultaneously. The injection current setting is difficult because the magnetic force works together so that the coil works to push or slow down the projectile. The genetic algorithm method is used to regulate the current injection to six coils that work together. The method we propose can control projectile motion in the barrel. Uniform multistage coils are used very effectively to regulate projectile motion inside the barrel. The design is shown through multistage coil simulation as a solution to control projectile motion. The Genetic Algorithm Method used in the calculations shows excellent results as expected with a maximum velocity of 31.43 m/s.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, we described a multi-chain ToA positioning method to estimate positions using all received Loran-C signals from multiple chains without constraining to a single chain and an ASF estimation method based on a receiver clock offset estimation. To validate these methods, we carried out a test. We firstly installed one receiver at fixed location in land and two receivers on the vessel. And we collected raw ToA measurements data from three receivers while the vessel moved along the path. Next, we estimated the ASF with the data provided by the land fixed receiver and measured the temporal change of ASF to generate the differential correction. The data provided by one of the receivers installed on the vessel was used to generate the ASF map. Loran-C multi-chain positioning was performed using the remaining receiver data. In this process, we mitigated the error by ASF using differential correction and ASF map. As a result, the horizontal positioning error was 2. 12m and 2DRMS was 24. 12m.",0,CHEAT
"In recent years, the opportunistic routing (OR) paradigm has been shown as one of the most viable solutions at the network layer for efficient data delivery under the nosily underwater acoustic channel. Since then, several OR protocols for underwater sensor networks, with major and minor variations, were proposed in the literature. While the performance of these protocols, in terms of data delivery rate, delay, and energy consumption, has been extensively studied in the literature, there is a lack of studies devoted for the evaluation of the topological properties OR will incur. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the candidate set selection procedures of opportunistic routing protocols designed for underwater sensor networks. We discuss the principles that have been extensively considered for the design of OR protocols for underwater sensor networks. Moreover, we conduct a simulation-based performance evaluation to study topological properties (e.g., number of hops, number of paths and number of candidates), which will impact the performance of underwater wireless sensor network applications.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, we propose a novel deep sparse coding network (SCN) capable of efficiently adapting its own regularization parameters for a given application. The network is trained end-to-end with a supervised task-driven learning algorithm via error backpropagation. During training, the network learns both the dictionaries and the regularization parameters of each sparse coding layer so that the reconstructive dictionaries are smoothly transformed into increasingly discriminative representations. In addition, the adaptive regularization also offers the network more flexibility to adjust sparsity levels. Furthermore, we have devised a sparse coding layer utilizing a “skinny” dictionary. Integral to computational efficiency, these skinny dictionaries compress the high-dimensional sparse codes into lower dimensional structures. The adaptivity and discriminability of our 15-layer SCN are demonstrated on six benchmark datasets, namely Cifar-10, Cifar-100, STL-10, SVHN, MNIST, and ImageNet, most of which are considered difficult for sparse coding models. Experimental results show that our architecture overwhelmingly outperforms traditional one-layer sparse coding architectures while using much fewer parameters. Moreover, our multilayer architecture exploits the benefits of depth with sparse coding's characteristic ability to operate on smaller datasets. In such data-constrained scenarios, our technique demonstrates a highly competitive performance compared with the deep neural networks.",0,CHEAT
"In the modern world, image transmission, including transmission of television and video signals, is carried out using a preliminary and restorative correction according to the law, which was due to the use of imaging devices on cathode ray tubes. This law differs from the law of dependence of the visibility threshold of a visual stimulus on its magnitude, but continues to be used for compatibility reasons. Therefore, in the work, instead of linearizing the sensations of the quantization scale of a television signal, it is proposed to optimize the choice of code combinations for image transmission. This approach can be effective in television systems without compression of video information with losses, for example, for transmitting signals over short distances or in channels for transmitting signals of the image of Earth remote sensing systems.",0,CHEAT
"Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the storage of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) on mobile cloud environments, where mobile devices are integrated with cloud computing to facilitate medical data exchanges among patients and healthcare providers. This advanced model enables healthcare services with low operational cost, high flexibility, and EHRs availability. However, this new paradigm also raises concerns about data privacy and network security for e-health systems. How to reliably share EHRs among mobile users while guaranteeing high-security levels in the mobile cloud is a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a novel EHRs sharing framework that combines blockchain and the decentralized interplanetary file system (IPFS) on a mobile cloud platform. Particularly, we design a trustworthy access control mechanism using smart contracts to achieve secure EHRs sharing among different patients and medical providers. We present a prototype implementation using Ethereum blockchain in a real data sharing scenario on a mobile app with Amazon cloud computing. The empirical results show that our proposal provides an effective solution for reliable data exchanges on mobile clouds while preserving sensitive health information against potential threats.

"Mutual coupling, which is caused by a tight inter sensor spacing in uniform linear arrays (ULAs), will, to a certain extent, affect the estimation result for source localisation. To address the problem, sparse arrays such as coprime array and nested array are considered to achieve less mutual coupling and more uniform degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) than ULAs. However, there are holes in coprime arrays leading to a decrease of uniform DoFs and in a nested array, some sensors may still be located so closely that the influence of mutual coupling between sensors remains significant. This paper proposes a new Loosely Distributed Nested Array (LoDiNA), which is designed in a three-level nested configuration and the three layers are linked end-to-end with a longer inter-element separation. It is proved that LoDiNA can generate a higher number of uniform DoFs with greater robustness against mutual coupling interference and simpler configurations, as compared to existing nested arrays. The feasibility of the proposed LoDiNA structure is demonstrated for Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation for multiple stationarysources with noise.",0,CHEAT

"In the stock selection problem, the Sharpe ratio is one of the commonly used indicators, but it tends to identify the portfolio with a flat trend as the best one.

"Deep learning models have gained great success in many real-world applications. However, most existing networks are typically designed in heuristic manners, thus these approaches lack rigorous mathematical derivations and clear interpretations. Several recent studies try to build deep models by unrolling a particular optimization model that involves task information. Unfortunately, due to the dynamic nature of network parameters, their resultant deep propagations do not possess the nice convergence property as the original optimization scheme does. In this work, we develop a generic paradigm to unroll nonconvex optimization for deep model design. Different from most existing frameworks, which just replace the iterations by network architectures, we prove in theory that the propagation generated by our proximally unrolled deep model can globally converge to the critical-point of the original optimization model. Moreover, even if the task information is only partially available (e.g., no prior regularization), we can still train convergent deep propagations. We also extend these theoretical investigations on the more general multi-block models and thus a lot of real-world applications can be successfully handled by the proposed framework. Finally, we conduct experiments on various low-level vision tasks (i.e., non-blind deconvolution, dehazing, and low-light image enhancement) and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches.",0,CHEAT
"With the development of ITS has brought in the necessity of executing various diverse applications by vehicular drivers or mobile users on vehicles. These applications required complex computation and high processing speed which is not available in the on-board units of vehicles. Thus cloud computing is introduced to execute such resource hungry applications. However, the physical distance of cloud from the users brought in undesired service delay. So cloudlets are introduced to reduce the physical distance and improve the service quality. Along with these more third party infrastructure needs to be introduced to meet the ever increasing demand of cloud resources. The onboard units of smart vehicles can collectively be used as third party infrastructure to execute large applications. This concept is referred to as vehicular cloud computing. In this work we propose a three tier vehicular cloud architecture where on road vehicles form the lower layer of cloud, middle layer consists of cloudlet servers associated with road side unit and the top most layer consists of the centralized cloud. Resources are allocated to users based on their task requirement. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to allocate optimized resources.

"360 videos provide an omnidirectional view of the scene with extremely large data. Therefore, representing 360 videos with less data has become more and more important. Cube format is such a popular representation of 360 videos. However, we have to convert cube to Equirectangula(ERP) for displaying convenience. In this paper, we enhance Cube-to-ERP conversion performance by joint using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and classical interpolation method. The optimal threshold of boundary is derived according to geometry features of the cube-to-ERP format. This threshold is the guidance of how to combine CNN and classical interpolation method. Our experiment results prove that the derived threshold has a certain degree of guiding significance. Furthermore, we propose a new evaluation criterion with the help of Marsaglia model.

Then, the Elman network was used to map the optimal sEMG features to the knee joint angles. The results show that the features extracted from the multichannel sEMG signals using the WCCD method proposed in this paper outperform the time-domain and frequency-domain methods.

As a first step, we coupled two different resolution levels of traffic simulation by using High Level Architecture (HLA) and evaluated this approach in light of simulation results and simulation performance.",0,CHEAT
"In the current paper, we present a comparative analysis of the wireless standards IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.6 over a WBAN healthcare monitoring system based on the MAC sub-layer. The main consideration of this work is to look for determined factors to decide about the norm providing the optimal quality of service (QoS) for such system in normal traffic conditions. For this purpose, a comprehensive set of simulations has been conducted using Castalia Simulator to evaluate the average latency, throughput and reliability of the two standards under the same conditions.",0,CHEAT
"The optokinetic reflex (OKR) is a behavioral oculomotor response which serves to stabilize moving images on the retina. As the cerebellum is intimately involved in the adaptive control of such compensatory eye movement, the OKR has been turned to a favorable test bed for modeling and assessing cerebellar learning function. Learning process in the cerebellum consists of two distinct phases: 1) short-term learning, which is acquired by single session of behavioral training and disappears within 24 hours, and 2) long-term learning which is induced by repeating sessions and persists for days. On the other hand, emerging evidences from experimental studies indicates high level of coordination between olivary system activity and cerebellar learning. However, it is still unclear which phase of learning will be affected by olivary system disruption. In this paper, we proposed a simple model for learning adaptation and memory formation of the cerebellum. The model is capable to reproduce the OKR gain adaptation of eye movement in both long and short term phases. The simulation results were found to strongly agree with previously reported experimental data from wild type mice. As a second step, we explore the effects of irreversible olivary system lesion on the gain adaptability of OKR by cutting off the connection of climbing fiber, which originates from the inferior olive (IO) neuron. Thereafter, comparing to the normal case, the gain of OKR undergoes a significant decline in both short and long phases of learning. This suggests that the olivary system plays a critical role in both short-and long-term adaption of OKR.",0,CHEAT

We mainly explore the direction of combining both lexical and semantic features for enhancing the retrieval task of possible answers to a posted question. We show a comprehensive evaluation on the SEMEval2017 CQA dataset for Arabic language. Our Mean Average Precision (MAP) achieves 62.85% when using a supervised machine learning approach (linear SVM). We outperformed best reported results on such dataset. This is achieved by defining a mix of word embedding, latent semantic similarity features and other lexical similarity features.",0,CHEAT
"The driver states, driving styles and aggressiveness strongly influences vehicle control, and energy efficiency. If the driving patterns can be collected and effectively analyzed the resulting classification can greatly improve the effectiveness and design of active safety system, advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) or energy efficient control. For an efficiency oriented analysis, artificial neural network (ANN) is used to classify drivers into aggressive, normal, and calm states through three different driving inputs: vehicle acceleration, speed and throttle pedal angle. The resultant models have fairly accurate classification according to different driving scenarios, with overall accuracy of 90%. The classification can be a reminder for the drivers of their current behavior, in-order for the drivers to take necessary actions to improve the driving condition.",0,CHEAT
"Recent radiomic studies have witnessed promising performance of deep learning techniques in learning radiomic features and fusing multimodal imaging data. Most existing deep learning based radiomic studies build predictive models in a setting of pattern classification, not appropriate for survival analysis studies where some data samples have incomplete observations. To improve existing survival analysis techniques whose performance is hinged on imaging features, we propose a deep learning method to build survival regression models by optimizing imaging features with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a proportional hazards model. To make the CNNs applicable to tumors with varied sizes, a spatial pyramid pooling strategy is adopted. Our method has been validated based on a simulated imaging dataset and a FDG-PET/CT dataset of rectal cancer patients treated for locally advanced rectal cancer. Compared with survival prediction models built upon hand-crafted radiomic features using Cox proportional hazards model and random survival forests, our method achieved competitive prediction performance.",0,CHEAT
"Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have obtained great attention since they reduce memory usage and power consumption as well as achieve a satisfying recognition accuracy on Image Classification. In particular to the computation of BNNs, the multiply-accumulate operations of convolution-layer are replaced with the bit-wise operations (XNOR and pop-count). Such bit-wise operations are well suited for the hardware accelerator such as in-memory computing (IMC). However, an additional digital processing unit (DPU) is required for the pop-count operation, which induces considerable data movement between the Process Engines (PEs) and data buffers reducing the efficiency of the IMC. In this paper, we present a BNN computing accelerator, namely CORN, which consists of a Spin-Orbit-Torque Magnetic RAM (SOT-MRAM) based data buffer to perform the majority operation (to replace the pop-count process) with the SOT-MRAM-based IMC to accelerate the computing of BNNs. CORN can naturally implement the XNOR operation in the NVM memory array, and feed results to the computing data buffer for the majority write operation. Such a design removes the pop-counter implemented by the DPU and reduces data movement between the data buffer and the memory array. Based on the evaluation results, CORN achieves 61% and 14% power saving with 1.74× and 2.12× speedup, compared to the FPGA and DPU based IMC architecture, respectively.",0,CHEAT
"To realize an efficient DTN (Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking) routing, it is required to quickly deliver the message from the source node to the destination node as well as to quickly delete disused message replicas from the network. Epidemic routing, which indefinitely forwards message replicas to all encountered nodes, realizes the near-optimal message delivery delay when a limited number of messages are transferred. However, its performance is significantly degraded when a number of messages are transferred simultaneously. In our previous work, we have proposed a simple but effective extension to epidemic routing called restrained epidemic routing, which intentionally suppresses message forwardings at the later stage of epidemic-style message dissemination. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of restrained epidemic routing when the contact relation between nodes is given by a general contact model such as complex networks. Specifically, we describe the dynamics of restrained epidemic routing on a complex network with a given degree distribution as differential equations using the degree-based mean field approximation.",0,CHEAT
"We introduce a new cavity-based wireless power transmission (WPT) system that could be applied to any cavity-based equipment regardless of its shape and size. The proposed scheme provides uniform and selective powering modes. In either powering mode, the field is isotropic, which removes the WPT-restrictions on placement and orientation of the energy harvester. The design process has three main steps, randomness creation, frequency selection, and waveform generation. We validate the proposed scheme in a lab lyophiliser's (freeze-drier) chamber. First, we create a random electromagnetic environment using mechanical stirring. Then, we evaluate this randomness in terms of the average to minimum power ratio. To select an appropriate frequency for the WPT system, we consider randomness and power uniformity. To maintain randomness, we extract the lowest usable frequency of the chamber using a Goodness of Fit test; this is found to be 6 GHz. As for the power uniformity, we plot the standard deviation (STD) of a large sample of the received powers at different locations. This plot is used to select the frequency based on an arbitrary uniformity level in terms of STD. At 6 GHz a 2.5 dB standard deviation is calculated. To enable the selective powering mode, we propose the electromagnetic time reversal (EMTR) technique. We show that EMTR can, theoretically, focus 97% of the energy on 0.5λ-diameter area in an ideally random environment.",0,CHEAT
"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a neurodegenerative disease. Functional connectivity networks (FCN) provide an effective method for analyzing brain functional regions connectivity. However, most methods only considered the neuroimaging information and focused on group relationship without the subjects' individual features, and ignored the demographic relationship. To handle it, in this paper, we introduce a novel method based on graph convolutional networks (GCN), which combines image and other information for MCI prediction tasks. The proposed model is capable of representing the individual features and data associations among subjects from potentially populations simultaneously. Specifically, we use different collection devices and gender information to build a graph called MCI-graph and modify convolutional neural networks (CNN) to construct GCN for MCI prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has achieved remarkable prediction performance.",0,CHEAT
"The economics of high performance computing are rapidly changing. Commercial cloud offerings, private research clouds, and pressure on the budgets of institutions of higher education and federally-funded research organizations are all contributing factors. As such, it has become a necessity that all expenses and investments be analyzed and considered carefully. In this paper we will analyze the return on investment (ROI) for three different kinds of cyberinfrastructure resources: the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE); the NSF-funded Jetstream cloud system; and the Indiana University (IU) Big Red II supercomputer, funded exclusively by IU for use of the IU community and collaborators. We determined the ROI for these three resources by assigning financial values to services by either comparison with commercially available services, or by surveys of value of these resources to their users. In all three cases, the ROI for these very different types of cyberinfrastructure resources was well greater than 1 - meaning that investors are getting more than $1 in returned value for every $1 invested. While there are many ways to measure the value and impact of investment in cyberinfrastructure resources, we are able to quantify the short-term ROI and show that it is a net positive for campuses and the federal government respectively.",0,CHEAT

"Periodic fractographic analysis of fracture surfaces helps improve performance of mechanical pieces and avoids economical and security problems in many industries, such as the automotive industry. Classifying a fracture into a failure mode is necessary to determine the causes that generated the fracture in the first place. Experts in fracture classification of metallic materials usually use texture and surface marks to determine the type of fracture. Deep Learning is a machine learning technique that learns features directly from input data and has achieved outstanding results in object classification. However, when it comes to texture classification, the results of deep learning are not as good as in other classification tasks. This paper proposes to improve the performance of deep learning for texture analysis in the context of fractographic classification by extracting handcrafted features (Haralick, fractal dimension and local binary patterns) from the output of the convolutional layers of the VGG-19 model. Four datasets are used in this paper. Two common textural databases, KTH-TIPS and KTH-TIPS2-B, are used as benchmark for the texture recognition problem, and two datasets of fractures are used for evaluation of the proposed methods. One of the datasets for evaluation corresponds to real-scale images of ductile, brittle and fatigue fractures; and the other dataset corresponds to images acquired with a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of ductile, brittle, fatigue and corrosion fatigue fractures. The best performance for the KTH-TIPS and KTH-TIPS2-B datasets was attained with local binary patterns (LBP) extracted from the first feature map of the third convolutional layer with an F1-score of 1.0 and from the second feature map of the fifth convolutional layer group with an F1-score of 0.77, respectively. In the case of the fracture database of real-scale images, the best performance was attained with fractal dimension features extracted from the feature maps of the first convolutional layer with an F1-score of 0.72, and with LBP extracted from the first feature maps of the fourth convolutional layer for the SEM images.",0,CHEAT
"With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), scalability becomes a significant concern due to the huge amounts of data generated in IoT systems. A centralized data exchange is not desirable as it leads to a single performance bottleneck. Although a distributed data exchange removes the central bottleneck, it has network performance issues as data passes among multiple coordinators. A decentralized approach is the only solution that fully enables the realization of efficient IoT systems, since there is no single performance bottleneck and network overhead is minimized. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages the semantics of DX-MAN for realizing decentralized data flows in IoT systems. The algebraic semantics of such a model allows a well-defined structure of data flows which is easily analyzed by an algorithm that forms a direct relationship between data consumers and data producers. For the analysis, the algorithm takes advantage of the fact that DX-MAN separates control flow and data flow. Thus, our approach prevents passing data alongside control among multiple coordinators, so data is only read and written on a decentralized data space. We validate our approach using smart contracts on the Blockchain, and conducted experiments to quantitatively evaluate scalability. The results show that our approach scales well with the size of IoT systems.",0,CHEAT
"Feature maps in Convolutional neural networks are extracted automatically with some initialization methods and training strategies, which greatly economizes the cost of feature engineering. However, correlation between feature maps are not considered in common networks, resulting in the increase of redundant feature maps with the networks becoming more complicated. In this work, we proposed the correlation layer and designed the correlation loss, which can compute the correlation coefficient matrix of the feature maps in the last convolutional layer and optimize the weights distribution respectively. In the training phase, 2 strategies, namely the supervision and initialization are studied with Gaussian and He initialization methods for the baseline. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrated that the supervision strategy for the multi-task training could efficiently reduce the correlation between the feature maps learned and increase the classification accuracy from 0.39% to 1.14% on the test set.",0,CHEAT
"For decades it has been acknowledged that sharing security information and collaboration between security practitioners are a necessity. Yet, effective sharing and collaboration are rare. A gamut of legislative acts, executive orders, academic works, and private sector initiatives have discussed aspects of the problem and aimed to be the catalyst needed to fix the situation. But almost 30 years since these efforts started, the state of sharing and collaboration is still technically complicated, slow, untrusted, and impeded by bureaucratic woes. This work identifies the challenges of sharing security artifacts and uses real-world examples to illustrate our findings. Based on this knowledge, we propose a new model for sharing and collaboration, CARE. The CARE architecture eases many of the privacy, secrecy, lineage, and structure issues that plague current sharing communities and platforms. We then build upon this foundation to introduce a marketplace based on smart contracts with transactional privacy over a distributed blockchain. Therefore, CARE incentivizes sharing, combats free riding, and provides an immutable ledger for the attribution of events. This paradigm shift, overcomes the challenges of sharing while providing new opportunities for business models, insurance risk assessments, and government backed incentivisation.",0,CHEAT
"In recent years, a large number of researchers investigate the conception of systems that use a unique Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAV) or multiple independent UAVs to conduct civil or military missions, with minimal human intervention. In this paper we focus on using multiple UAVs to cooperatively monitor a crowded area. Communication in such UAVs network is an ongoing project. Due to the lack of proper communication standards and rules, designing a reliable communication model is essential for: (i) multi-UAV coordination, (ii) efficient bandwidth sharing according to data priority and urgency and (iii) avoiding useless transmission of the same data by multiple UAVs. To address the above challenges, we propose a centralized data-oriented communication architecture for crowd surveillance allocations using an UAV fleet. The Ground Control Station (GCS) is used as a central coordinator to manage bandwidth usage for the UAV fleet in its coverage area. To allow UAVs to send priority messages urgently to the GCS, we define two classes of urgent messages: critical state and important result. The class of the data as well as other relevant information about the detected event will be used by the GCS to authorize or not UAV data transmission and hence to optimize the bandwidth usage efficiency.",0,CHEAT

"In this paper, we study the problem of integrated berth and quay crane allocation (I-BCAP) in general seaport container terminals and propose the model predictive allocation (MPA) algorithm and preconditioning methods for solving the I-BCAP. First, we propose a dynamical modeling framework based on discrete-event systems (DESs), which describes the operation of a berthing process with multiple discrete berthing positions and multiple quay cranes. Second, based on the discrete-event model, we propose the MPA algorithm for solving the I-BCAP using the model predictive control (MPC) principle with a rolling event horizon. The validation and performance evaluation of the proposed modeling framework and allocation method are done using: 1) extensive Monte Carlo simulations with realistically generated datasets; 2) real dataset from a container terminal in Tanjung Priuk port, located in Jakarta, Indonesia; and 3) real life field experiment at the aforementioned container terminal. The numerical simulation results show that our proposed MPA algorithm can improve the efficiency of the process where the total handling and waiting cost is reduced by approximately 6%-9% in comparison with the commonly adapted method of first-come first-served (FCFS) (for the berthing process) combined with the density-based quay cranes allocation (DBQA) strategy. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO)-based and genetic algorithm (GA)-based method proposed in the recent literature. The real life field experiment shows an improvement of about 6% in comparison with the existing allocation method used in the terminal.",0,CHEAT
"This paper proposes a novel method that addresses the selection of the dominant patterns of the histograms of oriented gradients (DPHOGs) in vehicle detection. HOG features lead to an expensive classification with high misclassification rates since HOG generates a long vector containing both redundant and ambiguous features (similarities between the vehicle and non-vehicle images). Several modifications of HOG were proposed to resolve these issues such as the vertical histograms of oriented gradient and one that includes position and intensity with HOG; however, these methods still contain some ambiguous features. A feature selection method can exclude these ambiguous features, allowing for better classification rates and a reduction in classification times. The proposed method uses the ideal vectors of the vehicle and non-vehicles images for selecting features in dominant patterns. The segments indicating the differences between the vehicle and non-vehicle classes are the dominant patterns, in which the length of the feature vector is shortened. We performed DPHOG on three standard datasets, in which the kernel extreme learning machine, the support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, and deep neural network were used as classifiers. We then compared the performance of the DPHOG with eight well-known feature selection methods and three existing feature extraction methods for vehicle detection. In evaluations with each comparative method concerning the accuracy, true positive, false positive, and F1-score, the DPHOG presented the highest performances with less running time in each dataset.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, a new behavioural mixer model is introduced. In addition to amplitude nonlinearity; phase nonlinearity and memory effect of the mixer are modelled in a multi-box structure.

The proposed behavioural model delivers a good match between measured and simulation results. The mixer model may be curve fitted to the characteristics of any mixer by optimizing its variable parameters and thus can be used in modelling different types of mixers. Thus, the proposed mixer model may be used in computer simulation tools and in linearization applications.",0,CHEAT
"Video-based human action recognition is currently one of the most active research areas in computer vision. Various research studies indicate that the performance of action recognition is highly dependent on the type of features being extracted and how the actions are represented. Since the release of the Kinect camera, a large number of Kinect-based human action recognition techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, there still does not exist a thorough comparison of these Kinect-based techniques under the grouping of feature types, such as handcrafted versus deep learning features and depth-based versus skeleton-based features. In this paper, we analyze and compare 10 recent Kinect-based algorithms for both cross-subject action recognition and cross-view action recognition using six benchmark datasets. In addition, we have implemented and improved some of these techniques and included their variants in the comparison. Our experiments show that the majority of methods perform better on cross-subject action recognition than cross-view action recognition, that the skeleton-based features are more robust for cross-view recognition than the depth-based features, and that the deep learning features are suitable for large datasets.",0,CHEAT
"This paper investigates the applicability of deep and machine learning techniques to perform beam selection in the uplink of a mmWave communication system.

To that aim, we consider three machine/deep learning schemes: k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector classifiers (SVC), and the multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conduct an extensive performance evaluation to assess the impact of using the Capon or MUSIC methods to estimate the AoAs and powers, the size of the training dataset, the number of beamformers in the codebook, their beamwidth, or the number of active users. Computer simulations reveal that performance, in terms of classification accuracy and sum-rate, is very close to that achievable via exhaustive search.",0,CHEAT

"WiFi is increasingly used by carriers for opportunistically offloading the cellular network infrastructure or even for increasing their revenue through WiFi-only plans and WiFi on-demand passes. Despite the importance and momentum of this technology, the current deployment of WiFi access points (APs) by the carriers follows mostly a heuristic approach. In addition, the prevalent free-of-charge WiFi access policy may result in significant opportunity costs for the carriers, as this traffic could yield non-negligible revenue. In this paper, we study the problem of optimizing the deployment of WiFi APs and pricing the WiFi data usage with the goal of maximizing carrier profit. Addressing this problem is a prerequisite for the efficient integration of WiFi to next-generation carrier networks. Our framework considers various demand models that predict how traffic will change in response to alteration in price and AP locations. We present both optimal and approximate solutions and reveal how key parameters shape the carrier profit. Evaluations on a dataset of WiFi access patterns indicate that WiFi can indeed help carriers reduce their costs while charging users about 50% lower than the cellular service.",0,CHEAT
"Video games like movies and music are considered as a popular entertainment. Because of their intractability, people get the chance to alleviate daily stress, find satisfaction and be the heroic version of themselves.

"Wind is one of the most essential sources of clean, renewable energy, and is, therefore, a critical element in responsible power consumption and production. The accurate prediction of wind speed plays a key role in decision-making and management in wind power generation.

The proposed model, named AIS-RNN, consists of two main components: the first neural network learns to generate context-dependent importance weights to dynamically select the input. The selected input is then fed into the second module for predicting the target variable. The experimental results show that our proposed end-to-end approach outperforms machine learning-based baselines on several public benchmark datasets. The AIS-LSTM model achieves higher performance on a public M3 dataset than the M3-specialized models. Furthermore, the AIS-RNN gives a beneficial advantage to interpret variable importance.",0,CHEAT
Diseases such as stroke and proprioception loss may cause inability to control the arm in the activities of daily living. Studies show that intensive motor training with virtual reality games can help patients to restore arm functions. This paper proposes a pseudo-haptic feedback method to add motion assistance or resistance to virtual reality-mediated upper-limb rehabilitation. The alterations to the cursor speed produced by the proposed technique create the illusion of virtual forces providing motion assistance or resistance to the arm movement during rehabilitation training. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated involving human subjects to demonstrate the feasibility. The experimental results reveal that the motion assistance mode is more time-efficient and is claimed to be easier than the motion resistance mode by human subjects. The difficulty of the path following task of virtual reality-mediated upper-limb rehabilitation training can be modulated by the proposed pseudo-haptic feedback method without using any haptic feedback devices.,0,CHEAT
"This paper presents a tracking control scheme with quantization mechanism for hypersonic flight vehicles (HFVs) with prescribed performance using an interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN). A parameterized tracking error model of the HFV is derived with some considered uncertainties, which are approximated by an IT2FNN. The tracking control of the velocity and altitude of the HFV is designed by using a prescribed performance control technique. It allows that transient characteristics of the tracking errors can be improved and adjusted by some prescribed performance functions. According to an adaptive backstepping control design procedure, novel continuous control laws of the fuel equivalency ratio, canard deflection, and elevator deflection are designed with logarithmic quantization mechanism, for the sake of avoiding inadvertently increasing the effective gains of continuous controllers as well as reducing loads of the communication from controller unit to actuator unit. Besides, the limited tracking errors of the flight path angle and angle-of-attack can be achieved by applying the designed controllers. Finally, the presented tracking controllers with quantization mechanism are validated by comparative simulations.",0,CHEAT
"Surface exploration by the distributed robots is a countermeasure way to the solo exploration by using a large and expensive rover. The distributed rover can explore a large area at the same time, and it is expected to improve the exploration speed. However, the mass resource of the distributed small rover is limited. A small and lightweight position and attitude estimation system is also required for rover guidance and control. In this paper, we propose a compact, lightweight attitude and position estimation system for distributed rover using light from the leader agent. A small photodiodes are used as a sensor of a position estimation system using light for the small exploration rover. Photodiodes mounted on the follower rover in different directions detect the light from the leader to estimate the vector in the light source direction with respect to the rover body coordinate system. The attitude is decided by using the estimated light source direction vector and the gravitational vector by the acceleration sensor in the rover. After determining the attitude, the distance between the leader rover and the follower rover is estimated using the elevation angle of the light source and the light source height information. If there is communication between the leader and followers, more complicated mutual position recognition is possible, but here we discuss the limits that can be achieved with minimum hardware. We also describe the light source recognition from the leader rover under ambient light, and also discuss the overall scheme of the exploration system.",0,CHEAT

"The remote sensing images are captured by high-altitude satellites, and the coverage of each image scene is relatively large. It tends to have large intraclass differences and small differences between classes. Using conventional Hierarchical ELM (H-ELM) and multilayer kernel ELM (ML-KELM) to classify remote sensing image scenes, the network structure of the learning model is deep and the parameters are many. This leads to long training time and large memory consumption. In order to solve this problem, based on the ML-KELM, this paper proposes a densely connected kernel ELM (Dense-KELM) learning model, which is used to classify remote sensing image scenes. Experimental results show that at the same model depth, the Dense-KELM model has higher classification accuracy in remote sensing image scenes than the H-ELM and the ML-KELM. Its training time is slightly larger than the ML-KELM but much smaller than the H-ELM. This densely connected learning model can extract high-level features of remote sensing images more effectively, represent the details between remote sensing scenes, and improve the classification accuracy of remote sensing image scenes. Moreover, the densely connected network structure can effectively reduce the number of parameters of the depth model, improve the training speed of the model, and save the storage space of the model.",0,CHEAT

"Internet of Things (IoT) refers to networks with billions of physical devices for collecting, sharing, and utilizing data in the virtual world. Most of IoT applications centralize security assurance in creating, authenticating, transferring, or delating system components. However, the centralization exposes its limitations to meet security needs of a rapidly growing number of things world-widely. How to scale up the applications with assured security becomes a critical challenge. Blockchain technology (BCT) is a promising solution to provide security and protect privacy in a large scale; especially, smart contracts offer opportunities to improve the reliability of IoT applications. Smart contracts establish trusts for both of data and executed processes. Recently, many literature surveys and positioning articles have been published on the integration of BCT with IoT, but they are limited to superficial discussions of technical potentials, and very few of them have a thorough exploration of the challenges in developing BCT for IoT at technical levels. This paper uses the system design approach to scrutinize the state of the art of study on BCT-based applications and clarify critical research areas of enabling BCT for security assurance: 1) the relations of BCT and IoT are modeled and discussed; 2) the needs of eliminating threats in IoT-based applications are defined as functional requirements (FRs), existing works on enabling technologies of BCT are defined as the physical solutions (PSs); and 3) the mappings between FRs and PSs are established to identify the limitations and the critical areas for the applications of BCT in large-scale distributed environment.",0,CHEAT
"Accurately identifying DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) from protein sequence information is an important but challenging task for protein function annotations. In this paper, we establish a novel computational method, named TargetDBP, for accurately targeting DBPs from primary sequences. In TargetDBP, four single-view features, i.e., AAC (Amino Acid Composition), PsePSSM (Pseudo Position-Specific Scoring Matrix), PsePRSA (Pseudo Predicted Relative Solvent Accessibility), and PsePPDBS (Pseudo Predicted Probabilities of DNA-Binding Sites), are first extracted to represent different base features, respectively. Second, differential evolution algorithm is employed to learn the weights of four base features. Using the learned weights, we weightedly combine these base features to form the original super feature. An excellent subset of the super feature is then selected by using a suitable feature selection algorithm SVM-REF+CBR (Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination with Correlation Bias Reduction). Finally, the prediction model is learned via using support vector machine on the selected feature subset. We also construct a new gold-standard and non-redundant benchmark dataset from PDB database to evaluate and compare the proposed TargetDBP with other existing predictors.

"In recent years, AC power flow equations have been gaining relevance to represent the transmission planning problem.

"Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that has gained significant attention and growth in recent years. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin does not rely on a centralized authority to control the supply, distribution, and verification of the validity of transactions. Instead, Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of volunteers to distribute pending transactions and confirmed blocks, to verify transactions, and to collectively implement a replicated ledger that everyone agrees on. This P2P network is at the heart of Bitcoin and many other blockchain technologies. In this paper, we present a comparative measurement study of nodes in the Bitcoin network. We measure and analyze how many the so-called “volunteers” are in the Bitcoin P2P network by scanning the live Bitcoin network for 37 days in 2018 and compare them with the data reported by prior work in 2013~2016. This paper is motivated by the fact that Bitcoin has experienced explosive growth in terms of a number of users, transactions, value, and interest over a recent couple of years. Our investigation includes the IP addresses of Bitcoin nodes, size of the network, power law in the geographic distribution, protocol, and client versions, and network latencies and shows how today's network is different from early days.

"Information fusion is an essential part of numerous engineering systems and biological functions, e.g., human cognition. Fusion occurs at many levels, ranging from the low-level combination of signals to the high-level aggregation of heterogeneous decision-making processes. While the last decade has witnessed an explosion of research in deep learning, fusion in neural networks has not observed the same revolution. Specifically, most neural fusion approaches are ad hoc, are not understood, are distributed versus localized, and/or explainability is low (if present at all). Herein, we prove that the fuzzy Choquet integral (ChI), a powerful nonlinear aggregation function, can be represented as a multilayer network, referred to hereafter as ChIMP. We also put forth an improved ChIMP (iChIMP) that leads to a stochastic-gradient-descent-based optimization in light of the exponential number of ChI inequality constraints. An additional benefit of ChIMP/iChIMP is that it enables explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).

"Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has become a key enabling technology for 5G and beyond networks because of its large bandwidth and high transmission rate. In a vehicular mmWave system, beam tracking is a challenging task due to the user's fast mobility and narrow beam of mmWave transmission. In this paper, we study the intelligent beam tracking scheme with low training overhead for mmWave vehicular transmission. Specifically, we utilize the past channel state information (CSI) to efficiently predict the future channel by designing a machine learning prediction model. Using such predicted CSI, the base stations (BSs) reduce the number of channel estimations and save the overhead of pilots. We build the prediction model based on a long short term memory (LSTM) structure whose dataset is composed of the channel vectors of each coherence time duration. The experiments show that the proposed LSTM can accurately predict the channel of the vehicular user and achieve satisfactory transmission rate with less pilot overhead than that of traditional beam training scheme.",0,CHEAT

"Due to the spectrum scarcity issue in conventional cellular networks, millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology has been proposed and is expected to be used in small cells to meet the requirements for spectrum resources, especially for those small cells that are densely deployed and form a multi-hop backhaul structure. For this novel architecture, a cross-layer optimization problem aiming at maximizing the energy efficiency while taking into account both the route selection and resource allocation is formulated. To find the optimal solution, we first decouple the original problem into a resource allocation sub-problem at the link-physical layer and a route selection sub-problem at the network layer. Since the resource allocation sub-problem at the link-physical layer is a non-convex problem and NP-hard, we apply stochastic algorithms to search for the optimal solution. Since the network layer sub-problem is simplified as a linear programming problem, an LP solver is applied to optimize energy efficiency. To reflect the interplay between these two problems, we further propose two joint optimization strategies. One uses stochastic algorithms that are composed of four schemes with given routes for resource allocation and linear programming for the route selection based on the given resource allocation. The other uses the linear programming to evaluate the fitness of each individual in the stochastic algorithms. The simulation results reveal the following: 1) our proposed schemes are capable of finding near-optimal solutions and can improve the energy and spectrum efficiency; and 2) properly finding the route without overloading any one of the base stations is capable of improving the throughput of the networks.",0,CHEAT
"Currently, the security situation of data security and user privacy protection is increasingly serious in cloud environment. Ciphertext data storage can prevent the risk of user's privacy disclosure. But how to search keyword on ciphertext data without revealing keyword information becomes a new challenge. Searchable encryption (SE) is put forward for this reason, which can be used to realize ciphertext-search directly. In terms of multi-user data sharing, public-key encryption with keywords search (PEKS) is more widely used than symmetric searchable encryption. PEKS has been widely studied and developed by researchers in recent years. However, the existing PEKS scheme often lacks flexible access policy. Therefore, combining the advantage of policy control on attribute-based encryption (ABE), and as that the bilinear pairing related assumption is fragile in post-quantum era, lattice-based cryptography is considered as one of secure encryption technology against quantum attack. With this background, in this paper, we give a keyword-searchable ABE scheme based on the hardness of lattice problems, our scheme supports flexible attribute control policy by integrating ABE and PEKS, and the security of new scheme is proved under the learning with errors (LWE) assumption. As lattice-based cryptographic technology is currently thought to be resistant to quantum attacks, so the new scheme has stronger security in a quantum era.",0,CHEAT
"Matrix completion has been widely used in image processing, in which the popular approach is to formulate this issue as a general low-rank matrix approximation problem. This paper proposes a novel regularization method referred to as truncated Frobenius norm (TFN), and presents a hybrid truncated norm (HTN) model combining the truncated nuclear norm and truncated Frobenius norm for solving matrix completion problems. To address this model, a simple and effective two-step iteration algorithm is designed. Further, an adaptive way to change the penalty parameter is introduced to reduce the computational cost. Also, the convergence of the proposed method is discussed and proved mathematically. The proposed approach could not only effectively improve the recovery performance but also greatly promote the stability of the model. Meanwhile, the use of this new method could eliminate large variations that exist when estimating complex models, and achieve competitive successes in matrix completion. Experimental results on the synthetic data, real-world images, and recommendation systems, particularly the use of the statistical analysis strategy, verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, i.e., the proposed method is more stable and effective than the other state-of-the-art approaches.",0,CHEAT
"Driven by recent computer vision and robotic applications, recovering 3D human poses has become increasingly important and attracted growing interests. In fact, completing this task is quite challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints, occlusions and inherently geometric ambiguities inside monocular images. Most of the existing methods focus on designing some elaborate priors /constraints to directly regress 3D human poses based on the corresponding 2D human pose-aware features or 2D pose predictions. However, due to the insufficient 3D pose data for training and the domain gap between 2D space and 3D space, these methods have limited scalabilities for all practical scenarios (e.g., outdoor scene). Attempt to address this issue, this paper proposes a simple yet effective self-supervised correction mechanism to learn all intrinsic structures of human poses from abundant images. Specifically, the proposed mechanism involves two dual learning tasks, i.e., the 2D-to-3D pose transformation and 3D-to-2D pose projection, to serve as a bridge between 3D and 2D human poses in a type of “free” self-supervision for accurate 3D human pose estimation. The 2D-to-3D pose implies to sequentially regress intermediate 3D poses by transforming the pose representation from the 2D domain to the 3D domain under the sequence-dependent temporal context, while the 3D-to-2D pose projection contributes to refining the intermediate 3D poses by maintaining geometric consistency between the 2D projections of 3D poses and the estimated 2D poses. Therefore, these two dual learning tasks enable our model to adaptively learn from 3D human pose data and external large-scale 2D human pose data. We further apply our self-supervised correction mechanism to develop a 3D human pose machine, which jointly integrates the 2D spatial relationship, temporal smoothness of predictions and 3D geometric knowledge. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and HumanEva-I benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our framework over all the compared competing methods.",0,CHEAT

However, some researchers have reported that ERD features have severe inter-subject variation.

"A new approach for diminution of side lobe Ratio or level (SLL)maximum with half power beam width (HPBW) of thinned large multiple concentric circular antenna of the uniformly exuberated isotropic element, is proposed. Itis a novel optimization algorithm based on Seeker Optimization Algorithm (SOA) is used. Concentric Circular Antenna Array (CCAA) has been greatly recognized within subject of base radio station of the radio and telecommunications system.

"Today, a wide variety of applications with different requirements are rapidly developed in industrial wireless sensor networks, and providing the Quality of Service (QoS) for this kind of communication network is inevitable. It is difficult to solve the problems of poor adaptability and difficulty in the implementation of the QoS-based network configuration and management in traditional network architecture. We present a hierarchical software-defined network architecture for wireless sensor networks, which makes the complex network management possible and the system more adaptable. Furthermore, we propose a QoS-based routing protocol, called QSDN-WISE, which consists of a clustering algorithm, a routing algorithm, and local network maintenance. A double-cluster head-based uneven clustering algorithm, called DCHUC, avoids the energy hole phenomenon and reduces the workload of a single cluster head. The centralized QSDN-WISE routing algorithm constructs two heterogeneous forwarding paths for nodes, which meets the requirements for different data levels.

The simulation results indicate that the QSDN-WISE can provide the QoS support for data with different requirements, balance the network energy consumption, and prolong the network's lifetime.",0,CHEAT
"We consider the problem of estimating an undisturbed, scalar, linear process over a “timing” channel, namely a channel where information is communicated through the timestamps of the transmitted symbols. Each transmitted symbol is received at the decoder subject to a random delay. The encoder can encode messages in the holding times between successive transmissions and the decoder must decode the message from the inter-reception times of successive symbols. This set-up is analogous to a telephone system where a transmitter signals a phone call to the receiver through a “ring” and, after the random time required to establish the connection, is aware of the “ring” being received. We show that for the estimation error to converge to zero in probability, the timing capacity of the channel should be at least as large as the entropy rate of the process. In the case the symbol delays are exponentially distributed, we show a tight sufficient condition using a random-coding strategy.",0,CHEAT
"This brief presents analytical results on the effect of additive weight/bias noise on a Boltzmann machine (BM), in which the unit output is in {-1, 1} instead of {0, 1}. With such noise, it is found that the state distribution is yet another Boltzmann distribution but the temperature factor is elevated. Thus, the desired gradient ascent learning algorithm is derived, and the corresponding learning procedure is developed. This learning procedure is compared with the learning procedure applied to train a BM with noise. It is found that these two procedures are identical. Therefore, the learning algorithm for noise-free BMs is suitable for implementing as an online learning algorithm for an analog circuit-implemented BM, even if the variances of the additive weight noise and bias noise are unknown.",0,CHEAT
"To increase noise immunity of the MFCC (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) widely used for voice signal parametrisation it is suggested to use a psychoacoustic model of frequency masking. Additionally, taking into account the formation mechanism of the formant regions in the voice signal spectrum it is suggested to influence the spectral samples corresponding to multiple harmonics of the fundamental tone. The modified algorithm is investigated on the basis of the single word recognition system adapted for MFCC voice signal parametrisation only. The positive effect of using proposed additional voice signal transformation in the parametrisation algorithm is shown.",0,CHEAT
"The security situation of the Internet of Things (IoT) is more serious than ever, and there is an urgent need to detect and patch device vulnerability rapidly. With the astronomical numbers of IoT devices, it is very difficult to execute regular security inspections. Existing vulnerability detection technology based on simple feature matching cannot reach high accuracy to detect firmware vulnerabilities while using a control flow graph matching directly has proven to be too expensive. To address the problem of accurate and efficient, we present a method of staged firmware vulnerability detection based on code similarity. The first stage, function embedding based on neural network is used to analyze the similarities among functions, and large-scale firmware security inspection can be achieved efficiently. The second stage, the similarity among function local call flow graphs is calculated for fine-grained firmware security analysis, and this stage can improve the accuracy of vulnerability detection. We compared our method with state-of-the-art approaches, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method is more accurate. The average retraining time of our method is 1 h, and the real-world firmware vulnerability detection experiment of our method demonstrates that the true positive rate of the top 30 is as high as 86%.",0,CHEAT
"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is a promising technology for Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In this paper, we combine UAV communication and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for constructing high capacity IoT uplink transmission systems, where UAVs are used as aerial base stations for collecting data from IoT nodes while NOMA is invoked for uplink transmission. We aim to maximize the system capacity by jointly optimize the subchannel assignment, the uplink transmit power of IoT nodes, and the flying heights of UAVs. We commence by proposing an efficient subchannel assignment algorithm relying on the classic K-means clustering method and matching theory. Then, we determine both the distributed uplink transmit power of IoT nodes and flying heights of UAVs based on successive optimization approach. An alternative optimization algorithm is also proposed for finding the near-optimal solutions. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme.",0,CHEAT
"Many applications of hyperspectral remote sensing involve automatic detection of solid targets. The design and applicability of such systems depend on their detection performance under various deployment scenarios; thus, it is useful to develop an accurate and realistic performance model. In this paper, we present a hyperspectral target detection performance prediction model for the common matched filter and normalized matched filter detection algorithms. A statistical model for hyperspectral data is discussed, which includes a replacement model for target pixels and a finite mixture of t-elliptically contoured distributions for background materials. For this general input model, analytic forms for detector output distributions are not always available. The main contribution of this paper is to develop an efficient and robust performance simulation technique using Monte Carlo (MC) with importance sampling. Compared to standard MC, our simulation technique requires a substantially smaller sample size to obtain accurate performance estimates at low false alarm rates. The proposed technique is useful for predicting detection performance over a wide range of input models when analytic solutions are unavailable.",0,CHEAT

"In view of the disadvantages of the traditional static measurement methods, such as low efficiency, inconvenient storage of data and higher requirements for the testers, a dynamic measurement method for real-time online measurement of the amplitude frequency response of the broadcasting transmitter is proposed, and the model and test principle of the measurement system are explained. In this method, the input and output signals of the broadcast transmitter are collected in real time. First, the generalized cross correlation algorithm is used to find the system delay, and then the system amplitude-frequency response is calculated by the FFT algorithm of time delay data interception. Experiments show that the method is accurate and reliable, so it has good practicability and generalization.",0,CHEAT
"VANET broadcasting algorithm plays an important role in ensuring the reliability and speed of information interaction between vehicles. Recently, the multi-hop broadcast has become a promising direction. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop broadcasting algorithm called delay-constraint broadcast combined with resource reservation mechanism (DBCRRM) which can increase the packet delivery ratio (PDR) effectively. The proposed broadcasting algorithm can make use of the distance between the source node and receiving nodes to select the forwarding node and uses the resource reservation mechanism (RRM) to select the resource of timeslot and frequency. Meanwhile, the algorithm can ensure the delay in the permissible range. Due to the difficulty of the field test in VANET broadcasting algorithms, most VANET broadcasting algorithms are only evaluated by simulation but lack the results of field tests. To make up the deficiency, we design a field test platform for broadcasting algorithms in VANET, and practically test the delay-constraint broadcast (DB) and DBCRRM. Compared to the test results of two-hop broadcast and the one-hop broadcast, the DBCRRM and DB show the superiority and practicability.",0,CHEAT
"Existing forensic techniques for image manipulation localization crucially assume that probe pixels belong to one of exactly two classes, genuine or manipulated. This letter argues that this convention fuels mis-labeling particularly in unsupervised settings, where singular but genuine content or the presence of multiple distinct manipulations may easily induce non-optimal partitions of the feature space. We propose to relax constraints via a greedy n-ary clustering approach, which we instantiate exemplarily in the popular pixel descriptor space of residual co-occurrences. Experimental results on widely used public benchmark datasets highlight the benefits of our approach.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, we propose a novel way for analysis of manufacturing data related to production of circuit breakers which are critical components of power distribution lines. Typically, the life span of a circuit breaker is of the order of 30 to 40 years. However, certain circuit breakers fail early within short span of 0-5 years and it's important to find out the reasons for early failure of these critical components. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to look into the manufacturing data to gain insight into the reasons for failures and provide recommendations to the manufacturer for improving the manufacturing process/operations based on these insights. The proposed approach is based on machine learning and data analytics.",0,CHEAT
"Integration of solid-liquid phase change materials (PCMs) into electronics packaging has demonstrated the potential to reduce the transient temperature rise of components that experience pulsed thermal loads. However, the impact on local temperature histories resulting from incorporating PCMs in different locations and configurations within an electronics package is not easy to analytically determine, due in large part to the non-linear response of PCMs to a transient heat load. ParaPower is a new parametric design tool to facilitate the design of electronics packages. The tool has the capability of easily incorporating arbitrarily located PCM volumes and evaluating their effect on temperature distributions within the electronics package as a function of time. This paper determines the spatial and temporal order of convergence for the reduced order phase-change thermal model which underlies ParaPower. The results are compared and validated against both an analytical solution and a higher-fidelity commercial finite element analysis (FEA) tool. This paper has shown the fast-solving methods used in the ParaPower tool give results with comparable accuracy to those obtained using high-fidelity commercial software. Reasonably good accuracy can be obtained with fairly large time steps and grid spacing allowing fast-solving design space exploration with this option to increase fidelity within the tool to obtain higher accuracy when necessary. This research quantifies the trade-off between time steps, grid size, and accuracy such that a useful balance can be obtained. Design tools, such as ParaPower, have the potential to significantly advance design theory to reduce size and cost as well as minimize the prevalence of overdesign.",0,CHEAT
"Public blockchain network (PBN) has been widely used in wired networks such as bitcoin network, in which proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm is deployed among miners to reach consensus on users data during the mining process. However, the PoW consensus mechanism is computation-consuming which obstacles the application of PBN in wireless mobile networks since most Internet of Things/mobile devices (IMDs) are resource limited. Recently, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been regarded as a promising technology which can allow IMDs to offload their computation tasks to the edge nodes. Although IMDs can offload their computation tasks to the edge nodes, there is still lots of competition among enormous solo mining IMDs when reaching consensus. In this paper, we first formulate the computation resource allocation problem of PBN from the viewpoint of coalition game theory under the MEC environment. Then, we propose a coalition formation game-based algorithm to maximize the system sum utility and take both the individual profit of IMD and coalition profit into consideration. Furthermore, we prove the proposed algorithm converges to a Nash-stable partition in a fast convergence rate and finally reaches the near-optimal solution with low computational complexity. The simulation results demonstrate the optimality and convergence of the proposed algorithm, and the proposed algorithm outperforms other schemes in terms of system sum profit and ratio of rewarded IMDs to overall IMDs.",0,CHEAT
"Good action recognition relies on correct interpretation of two critical attributes related to action: the spatial attribute on the detected person's posture, and the temporal attribute on the detected person's body movement. Whereas deep learning has greatly improved image recognition, we have not found a similar progress for action recognition. One of the main reasons is due to the complexity caused by the additional temporal dimension; another, to the fact that there are less annotated training data samples for action recognition than that for image recognition. In this regard, this paper proposes a handcrafted cued LSTM model for human action recognition based on RGB-D data, as a collection of 25 skeleton joints in 3D coordinates, found in NTU-RGB-D, currently the most comprehensive dataset for action recognition. As opposed to the raw data of skeleton joints, handcrafted cues, pre-processed results geared to facilitate focused learning, are proposed as input to the LSTM structure. In particular, pertaining to the spatial cue, the SVIT cue derived by Skeleton View-invariant Transformation is adopted; pertaining to the temporal cue, the Diff cue computed by taking the displacements of all joint across down-sampled raw data is utilized. Based on the train/test protocol, the experiment we conducted on NTU-RGB-D shows that the recognition result based on either of the proposed handcrafted cues is better than that based on the raw data. In addition, by our proposed techniques of feature fusion and/or decision fusion of these two handcrafted cues, the recognition performance is better than that of the state-of-the-art approaches conducting on the same dataset by same train/test protocol.",0,CHEAT
"Reducing delay and latency in cloud computing environment is a challenging task for the research community. There are several smart cities in the world. These smart cities contain numerous Smart Communities (SCs), which have number of Smart Buildings (SBs) and Smart Homes (SHs). They require resources to process and store data in cloud. To overcome these challenges, another infrastructure fog computing environment is introduced, which plays an important role to enhance the efficiency of cloud. The Virtual Machines (VMs) are installed on fog server to whom consumers' requests are allocated. In this paper, the cloud and fog based integrated environment is proposed. To overcome the delay and latency issues of cloud and to enhance the performance of fog. When there are a large number of incoming requests on fog and cloud, load balancing is another major issue. This issue has also been resolved in this paper. The load balancing algorithm Cuckoo search with Levy Walk distribution (CLW) and Flower Pollination (FP) are proposed. The proposed algorithms are compared with existing Cuckoo Search (CS) and BAT algorithm.

"Extracting agarwood consumes higher energy expenditure due to time consuming. Therefore, a controller scheme has been approached to avoid this shortcoming. With implementation of control strategy, the energy usage can be reduced and at the same time can improve the transient response performance. In this paper, the comparison between self-tuning FuzzyPID with 49 rules and PID controller (Ziegler-Nichols and AMIGO) tuning rules have been evaluated on transient response as well as energy consumption via simulation. For transient analyses, three criterias have been analysed which are settling time, rise time, and percentage of overshoot. Another evaluation which is energy consumption that has been evaluated by using Integral Absolute Control Signal (IACS). The simulation result demonstrated the self-tuning FuzzyPID achieved better performance in transient response and consumed lower in energy consumption than PID Controller.",0,CHEAT
"The aim of this paper is the implementation of a fuzzy logic controller for the compensating capacitor voltage regulation of a shunt active filter, based on the indirect current control. The obtained performances of the fuzzy voltage controller are compared to the corresponding performances obtained on an identical system implemented with the well documented PI controller. Because the fuzzy controller output contains an important ripple, the possibility of using a low pass filter was investigated. It results that the fuzzy controller has an aperiodic response, but when adding a low pass filter at its output, the response is oscillatory, similar to the PI controller response. Although the compensation performance is better for the fuzzy controller, and the steady state regime is entered faster (with lower overshoot, when using the low pass filter), compared to the PI controller, the voltage regulation is poor. The regulation can be improved by properly adjusting the membership functions, with the cost of output ripple, which in turn, can be reduced by adding a low pass filter. The controller implementation and performance comparative study were accomplished on a comprehensive active compensator system built in the Matlab Simulink environment.",0,CHEAT
"Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is defined as failure to report, respond, or adjust to novel or meaningful stimuli presented to the side opposite a brain lesion. This symptom deteriorates the rehabilitation efficiency and hinders activities of daily living. USN is classified into 2 sub-categories: body-centered neglect and object-centered neglect. No optimal intervention has been proposed for treating object-centered neglect. Thus, we developed a visual cueing system using immersive virtual reality to improve object-centered neglect.

Here, we develop a reliable detection system which can adaptively match the changing environment and phishing websites. Our method is an online and feature-rich machine learning technique to discriminate the phishing and legitimate websites.

It is proposed to use transition probabilities for three-dimensional Markov chains and brightness characteristics averaged within a sliding window as textural features. To reduce computational resources, determination of signs is carried out by the bit planes of the senior, most informative digits of the digital image. The detection of texture objects is based on the analysis of the histogram of the texture feature and the brightness of the pixels.

"Due to the increasing uncertainty brought about by renewable energy, conventional deterministic dispatch approaches have not been very applicative. This paper investigates a nested sparse grid-based stochastic collocation method (NS-SCM) as a possible solution for stochastic economic dispatch (SED) problems. The SCM was used to simplify the scenario-based optimization model; specifically, a finite-order expansion using the generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) theory was applied to approximate random variables as a more facile approach compared to using complicated optimization models. Furthermore, a nested sparse grid-based approach was adopted to reduce the number of collocation points while still satisfying the nested property, thereby alleviating and effectively eliminating the need for computation. The proposed approach can be directly applied to the SED optimization problem. Lastly, simulations on the modified IEEE 39-bus system and a practical 1009-bus power system were provided to verify the accuracy, effectiveness, and practicality of the proposed algorithm.",0,CHEAT
"The minimum mean squared error (MMSE) is usually adopted as the training criterion for speech enhancement based on deep neural network (DNN).

Accordingly, we present a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to DNN parameter optimization. We analyze and discuss the effect of shape parameter of GGD on noise reduction and speech preservation. Experimental results on the TIMIT corpus show the proposed ML-based learning approach can achieve consistent improvements over MMSE-based DNN learning on all evaluation metrics. Less speech distortion is observed in ML-based approach especially for high frequency units than MMSE-based approach.",0,CHEAT
"A Website quality model essentially consists of a set of criteria used to determine if a website reaches certain levels of fineness. Quality attributes are imperative in predicting quality of a website. However large set features may increase model complexity and computational time for prediction. In this study an initial set of 13 quality attributes is prepared and two-stage feature selection based on hybrid filter-wrapper approach is used to optimize website quality prediction performance. In the first stage, each feature is ranked using the Information Gain (IG) method. In the second stage, Firefly Search Algorithm (FA) is applied to features which are ranked higher in the first stage and a feature sub-selection is carried out. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of feature selection method experiments are conducted using four baseline classification algorithms on a dataset prepared by 700 websites. The experimental results show that the proposed model is able to achieve high classification performance. An average of 36.53% reduction in features has been observed which leads to 0.015 seconds of average reduction in time for building a classifier and an average improvement of 5.420% in classification accuracy.",0,CHEAT
"Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) based on LoRa physical layer is envisioned as one of the most promising technologies to support future Internet of Things (IoT) systems. LoRa provides flexible adaptations of coverage and data rates by allocating different Spreading Factors (SFs) to end-devices. Although most works so far had considered perfect orthogonality among SFs, the harmful effects of inter-SF interferences have been demonstrated recently. Therefore in this work, we consider the problem of SF allocation optimization under co-SF and inter-SF interferences, for uplink transmissions from end-devices to the gateway. To provide fairness, we formulate the problem as maximizing the minimum achievable average rate in LoRa, and propose a SF allocation algorithm based on matching theory. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm enables to jointly enhance the minimal user rates, network throughput and fairness, compared to baseline SF allocation methods.",0,CHEAT
"Nonconvex reformulations via low-rank factorization for stochastic convex semidefinite optimization problem have attracted arising attention due to their empirical efficiency and scalability. Compared with the original convex formulations, the nonconvex ones typically involve much fewer variables, allowing them to scale to scenarios with millions of variables. However, it opens a new challenge that under what conditions the nonconvex stochastic algorithms may find the population minimizer within the optimal statistical precision despite their empirical success in applications. In this paper, we provide an answer that the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method can be adapted to solve the nonconvex reformulation of the original convex problem, with a global linear convergence when using a fixed step size, i.e., converging exponentially fast to the population minimizer within an optimal statistical precision in the restricted strongly convex case. If a diminishing step size is adopted, the bad effect caused by the variance of gradients on the optimization error can be eliminated but the rate is dropped to be sublinear. The core of our treatment relies on a novel second-order descent lemma, which is more general than the existing best result in the literature and improves the analysis on both online and batch algorithms. The developed theoretical results and effectiveness of the suggested SGD are also verified by a series of experiments.",0,CHEAT

"Advances on bidirectional intelligence are overviewed along three threads, with extensions and new perspectives. The first thread is about bidirectional learning architecture, exploring five dualities that enable Lmser six cognitive functions and provide new perspectives on which a lot of extensions and particularlly flexible Lmser are proposed. Interestingly, either or two of these dualities actually takes an important role in recent models such as U-net, ResNet, and DenseNet. The second thread is about bidirectional learning principles unified by best yIng-yAng (IA) harmony in BYY system. After getting insights on deep bidirectional learning from a bird-viewing on existing typical learning principles from one or both of the inward and outward directions, maximum likelihood, variational principle, and several other learning principles are summarised as exemplars of the BYY learning, with new perspectives on advanced topics. The third thread further proceeds to deep bidirectional intelligence, driven by long term dynamics (LTD) for parameter learning and short term dynamics (STD) for image thinking and rational thinking in harmony. Image thinking deals with information flow of continuously valued arrays and especially image sequence, as if thinking was displayed in the real world, exemplified by the flow from inward encoding/cognition to outward reconstruction/transformation performed in Lmser learning and BYY learning. In contrast, rational thinking handles symbolic strings or discretely valued vectors, performing uncertainty reasoning and problem solving. In particular, a general thesis is proposed for bidirectional intelligence, featured by BYY intelligence potential theory (BYY-IPT) and nine essential dualities in architecture, fundamentals, and implementation, respectively. Then, problems of combinatorial solving and uncertainty reasoning are investigated from this BYY IPT perspective. First, variants and extensions are suggested for AlphaGoZero like searching tasks, such as traveling salesman problem (TSP) and attributed graph matching (AGM) that are turned into Go like problems with help of a feature enrichment technique.

"Nowadays, Smart Environments (SEs) are pervasively deployed in buildings (e.g., houses, schools, and offices) and outdoor environments with the goal of improving the quality of life of their inhabitants. SEs are usually designed and developed by using well-suited architectures and platforms having the aim of simplifying and making straightforward the SE implementation.

Current research efforts are devoted to making such environments cognitive, i.e., able to automatically adapt and adhere to the possible changes in users' needs and behaviors. Anyway, in this field, the development of SEs is still in its infancy. In this direction, the paper proposes a novel Cognitive-enabled, Edge-based Internet of Things (CEIoT) architecture, purposely designed to develop cognitive IoT-based SEs. Such architecture wants to overcome some limitations arising during the usage of common SE platforms and architectures.

"Software quality attributes (e.g., security, performance) influence software architecture design decisions, e.g., when choosing technologies, patterns or tactics. As software developers are moving from big upfront design to an evolutionary or emerging design, the architecture of a system evolves as more functionality is added. In agile software development, functional user requirements are often expressed as user stories. Quality attributes might be implicitly referenced in user stories. To support a more systematic analysis and reasoning about quality attributes in agile development projects, this paper explores how to automatically identify quality attributes from user stories. This could help better understand relevant quality attributes (and potential architectural key drivers) before analysing product backlogs and domains in detail and provides the “bigger picture” of potential architectural drivers for early architecture decision making. The goal of this paper is to present our vision and preliminary work towards understanding whether user stories do include information about quality attributes at all, and if so, how we can identify such information in an automated manner.",0,CHEAT
"Noisy traces, gaps in coverage, or irregular/inadequate trace spacing are common problems in both land and marine surveys, possibly hindering the geological interpretation of an area of interest. This problem has been typically addressed in the literature using prestack data; however, prestack data are not always available. As an alternative, poststack interpolations may aid the geological interpretation by increasing the spatial density of a seismic section and can also be used to reconstruct entire sections by interpolating neighboring traces, reducing field costs. In this letter, we evaluate the performance of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) as an interpolation tool for improving seismic data resolution on a public poststack seismic data set and compare our results with the traditional cubic interpolation. To perform the comparisons, we used structural similarity (SSIM), mean squared error (mse), and local binary patterns (LBPs) texture descriptor. The results show that cGANs outperform traditional algorithms by up to 72% and that the texture descriptor was able to better capture image similarities, producing results more coherent with the visual perception.",0,CHEAT
"Increasing the road safety requires monitoring drivers' behaviour and evaluating their awareness. Low awareness related crashes have significantly increased in recent years due to the augmentation of social media and driver assistance systems. Accordingly, an advanced system is required to monitor the driver's behaviour and generate warning alarms if driver's performance degradation is detected. This study aims at evaluating the vehicle and driver's data to determine the performance of drivers the onset of degradation. Physiological signals such as perinasal and palm electrodermal activities, heart rate and breathing rate are measured during the simulated driving. Measurements are coming from healthy subjects (male/female and elderly/young). The lane deviation of the vehicle is treated as the response variable whether driver is impacted by stressor or not. Measured physiological signals are then processed and applied for developing machine learning tool for driver's performance evaluation. A mix of linear and non-linear classification algorithms is used for this purpose. Prediction results indicate that the random forest algorithm outperforms other methods by achieving an area under the curve of 0.92%.

This is typically done by applying convolutional neural networks to slices of a 3D brain image volume. Each slice of the brain volume, however, represents only a small cross-sectional area of the cortical layer. On the other hand, convolutional neural networks are less well developed for 3D volumes. Therefore we sought to apply deep networks to the 2D cortical surface, for the purpose of classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is known to affect the thickness and geometry of the cortical surface of the brain. Although the cortical surface has a complex geometry, here we present a novel data processing method to feed the information of an entire cortical surface into existing deep networks for more accurate early disease detection. A brain 3D MRI volume is registered and its cortical surface is flattened to a 2D plane. The flattened distributions of the thickness, curvature and surface area are combined into an RBG image which can be readily fed to existing deep networks. In this paper, the ADNI dataset of brain MRI scans are used and flattened cortical images are applied to different deep networks including ResNet and Inception. Two pre-clinical stages of AD are considered; stable mild cognitive impairment (MCIs) and converting mild cognitive impairment (MCIc). Experiments show that using flattened cortical images consistently leads to higher accuracy compared to using brain slices with the same network architecture. Specifically, the highest accuracy of 81% is achieved by Inception with flattened cortical images, as compared to 68% by the same network on brain slices and 75.9% accuracy by the best method in the literature which also used a deep network on brain slices. Our results indicate that flattened cortical images can be used to learn and classify AD with high accuracy.",0,CHEAT

"Cognitive impairment is associated with increased risk of disability, increased health care costs and potential progression to dementia. An emerging approach to counteract the impact of cognitive impairment is to empower patients with the appropriate tools to effectively manage their own condition. In this work we evaluate the use of KeepWell, a self-management smartphone application developed to assist people with early cognitive impairment to live independently. KeepWell provides services such as reminders, surveys, and educational information that allows users to set physical goals and monitor their physical performance. Participants involved in the evaluation of adoption and usability consisted of individuals diagnosed with early cognitive impairment. A qualitative and quantitative analysis was conducted with 5 and 2 such individuals respectively. Data was codified using grounded theory and affinity diagramming. The findings from the work have resulted in the development of a set of recommendations for the design of self-management mobile applications.",0,CHEAT
"Uploading virtual reality (VR) video over cellular networks is expected to boom in the near future, as general consumers could generate the high-quality VR videos with portable 360-degree cameras and are willing to share with others. Consequently, the concerns of uplink bandwidth and delay arose for current popular technology of tile-based VR video streaming, which requires high-quality video to transcode into multiple representations for further adaptive streaming. Motivated by this, we proposed a novel scheme for uplink delivery of tile-based VR video over cellular networks, in which encoding bit rate of each tile is determined by the uplink resource allocation (RA), and the quality of content (QoC) contribution of each tile and channel quality of user equipments (UEs) are jointly considered during RA. Moreover, the RA problem is formulated as a frequency and time dependent non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard problem. Furthermore, we propose three algorithms to explore solving the RA problem. The simulation results show that the proposed approximate convex algorithm with low-complexity can achieve higher utility, i.e., higher total quality of experience (QoE) for viewers.",0,CHEAT
"Network localization and synchronization (NLS) is a paradigm that considers joint inference of positions and clock parameters in a network consisting of completely asynchronous nodes. NLS has the potential to achieve significant performance gains in terms of localization and synchronization accuracy. In this paper, we derive fundamental performance limits of NLS by considering a problem formulation in the non-Bayesian inference framework, in which the waveforms received by different nodes in the network are considered as measurements. We perform equivalent Fisher information analysis to obtain bounds on the accuracy of NLS, and our results reveal how physical parameters and signal departure times affect the inference performance. The analytical results are verified by simulations based on a realistic channel model that takes spatial consistency into consideration.",0,CHEAT
"A novel hollow core antiresonant fiber made of a single material is numerically investigated. The design of the fiber cladding based on nested antiresonant tubes without additional radial interconnection struts suppresses the presence of spurious loss peaks and dips within the antiresonant windows, which benefits for the wide bandwidth and low loss transmission. Through simply adding antiresonant membranes, the leakage loss of the fiber can be effectively reduced and the bending loss is negligible. Adoption of this fiber design in the negative curvature fibers will lead to improved performance in terms of losses compared to previously reported antiresonat fibers.",0,CHEAT
"A wireless sensor network (WSN) has significant applications such as monitoring the far environmental and target tracking. This has been enabled by the sensors that are smaller, cheaper, and intelligent. These sensors are equipped with wireless interfaces that can communicated with each other to form a network. The design of a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factors such as the environment, the application’s design objectives, costs, hardware, and system constraints. However, the nodes closer to the sink in the network are overburdened with huge traffic loading known as hot spot problem as the data from the total region are forwarded through them to reach the sink node. As a result, their energy gets consumed quickly and the network is subdivided in to multiple region. This paper aims to study the grid based random clustering and grid based static clustering techniques in WSN and to evaluate the performance and compare between them by via simulation. The results show that grid based static clustering outperforms random clustering in term of throughput by 22%, reduces energy consumption by 30%, and increase residual energy by 20%. Thus, the network lifetime of the WSN will be prolonged.",0,CHEAT

Randomized symmetrical thinning is incorporated in the proposed algorithm to find the best combination of 'ON' and 'OFF' elements. Modified binary coded genetic algorithm (MBC-GA) is employed in the present study to solve this optimization problem. A 12×12-element TPA array is numerically examined to access the performance of proposed method. Results obtained through this study show that array under consideration renders maximum possible reduction in PSLL and also demonstrate the absence of grating lobes when the beam is scanned to 20 deg. and 40 deg. away from the boresight.",0,CHEAT
"Predicting stock market is not an easy task as it is a chaotic system i.e. whose dynamics are sensitive to arbitrarily small differences in initial conditions. Any small changes in the system can produce compound errors in predicting the future behavior of the system. Over the last few years, many machine learning algorithms have been used in an attempt to forecast stock prices. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a type of Recurrent Neural Network known as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to implement technical analysis for making predictions about stock prices of AAPL ticker from NASDAQ exchange. Performance with three popular output activation layers is tested with Adam optimizer as back-propagation algorithm. The performance is compared using Root Mean Square Deviation.

"Clustering is one of the effective techniques to conserve energy in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Its main objective is to organize the network into clusters, and selects a leader (for each cluster) defined as cluster-head (CH).

"Sensor localization is an important branch of wireless sensor networks. Traditional positioning algorithms rely on line-of-sight (LOS) transmission between transmitters and receiver to achieve high positioning accuracy. However, these methods may result in large error if they are fed with nonline-of-sight (NLOS) measurements. Since the errors caused by NLOS are always positive, a Cayley-Menger determinant (CMD) based NLOS identification and mitigation algorithm is proposed in this paper, referred to as CNIM. Firstly, all anchors are grouped and NLOS detection algorithm is carried out for each group to detect whether there exist NLOS signals. Then the specific LOS and NLOS anchors are identified by traversing the detection results of all groups. Finally, only LOS anchors are used to estimate the sensor location in combination with LS/RWGH localization algorithms. Simulations are conducted to investigate the performance of CNIM in comparison with other conventional algorithms. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",0,CHEAT
"Compressed sensing has been employed to reduce the pilot overhead for channel estimation in wireless communication systems. Particularly, structured turbo compressed sensing (STCS) provides a generic framework for structured sparse signal recovery with reduced computational complexity and storage requirement. In this paper, we consider the problem of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channel estimation in a frequency division duplexing (FDD) downlink system. By exploiting the structured sparsity in the angle-frequency domain (AFD) and angle-delay domain (ADD) of the massive MIMO-OFDM channel, we represent the channel by using AFD and ADD probability models and design message-passing-based channel estimators under the STCS framework. Several STCS-based algorithms are proposed for massive MIMO-OFDM channel estimation by exploiting the structured sparsity. We show that, compared with other existing algorithms, the proposed algorithms have a much faster convergence speed and achieve competitive error performance under a wide range of simulation settings.",0,CHEAT

"A growing body of research has uncovered the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in multiple biological processes and tumorigenesis. Predicting novel interactions between diseases and lncRNAs could help decipher disease pathology and discover new drugs. However, because of a lack of data, inferring disease-lncRNA associations accurately and efficiently remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a novel network consistency projection for LncRNA-disease association prediction (NCPLDA) model by integrating the lncRNA-disease association probability matrix with the integrated disease similarity and lncRNA similarity. The lncRNA-disease association probability matrix is calculated based on known lncRNA-disease associations and disease semantic similarity. The integrated disease similarity and lncRNA similarity are computed based on disease semantic similarity, lncRNA functional similarity and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity. In leave-one-out cross validation experiments, NCPLDA achieved outstanding AUCs of 0.8900, 0.8996, and 0.9012 for three datasets. Furthermore, prostate cancer and ovarian cancer case studies demonstrated that the NCPLDA can effectively infer undiscovered lncRNAs.",0,CHEAT
"Skeleton-based human action recognition has been a popular research field during the past few years. With the help of cameras equipping deep sensors, such as the Kinect, human action can be represented by a sequence of human skeleton data. Inspired by the skeleton descriptors based on Lie group, a spatial-temporal skeleton transformation descriptor (ST-STD) is proposed in this paper. The ST-STD describes the relative transformations of skeletons, including the rotation and translation during movement. It gives a comprehensive view of the skeleton in both spatial and temporal domain for each frame. To capture the temporal connections in the skeleton sequence, a denoising sparse long short term memory (DS-LSTM) network is proposed in this paper. The DS-LSTM is designed to deal with two problems in action recognition. First, to decrease the intra-class diversity, the spatial-temporal auto-encoder (STAE) is proposed in this paper to generate representations with higher abstractness. The denoising constraint and the sparsity constraint are applied on both spatial and temporal domain to enhance the robustness and to reduce action misalignment. Second, to model the action sequence, a three-layer LSTM structure is trained with STAE representations for temporal modeling and classification. The experiments are carried out on four popular datasets. The results show that our approach performs better than several existing skeleton-based action recognition methods, which prove the effectiveness of our method.",0,CHEAT

The best results in this case, which are achieved by applying the CPSO, are 85.71%, 86.21% and 87.88% for the definite, probable and improbable classes, respectively.

Our approach contains two components: the Style Transfer Network (STN) and the Style Removal Network (SRN). STN renders the style of the stylized image to the non-stylized image and the SRN is designed to remove the style of a stylized photo. By applying the two networks successively to an original input photo, the output should match the input photo. The experiment results in a variety of portraits and styles demonstrate our approach's effectiveness.",0,CHEAT

"Neighborhood area networks (NANs) are essential communication infrastructure in smart grid. They support communications for various applications including time-critical ones. A typical NAN communication scenario is to send commands from a control center simultaneously to a large number of nodes, demanding low-latency broadcast communications. This is challenging due to the limited bandwidth and large number of nodes in wireless NANs. While some broadcast schemes, e.g., opportunistic flooding, have been developed for general wireless sensor networks, they are not optimized for smart grid NANs with unique characteristics and low-latency requirements for time-critical applications. Therefore, a constrained broadcast scheme with minimized latency (CBS-ML) is presented in this paper for low-latency NAN communications. To avoid traffic congestion, it constrains the broadcast to a small number of core nodes. Theoretical developments are presented to show how to select core nodes based on network topology and link reliability. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the proposed CBS-ML.",0,CHEAT
"State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems use sequence discriminative training for improved performance over frame-level cross-entropy (CE) criterion. Even though sequence discriminative training improves long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) acoustic models (AMs), it is not clear whether these systems achieve the optimal performance due to overfitting. This paper investigates the effect of state-level minimum Bayes risk (sMBR) training on LSTM AMs and shows that the conventional way of performing sMBR by updating all LSTM parameters is not optimal. We investigate two methods to improve the performance of sequence discriminative training of LSTM AMs. First more feed-forward (FF) layers are included between the last LSTM layer and the output layer so those additional FF layers may benefit more from sMBR training. Second, a subspace is estimated as an interpolation of rank-1 matrices when performing sMBR for the LSTM layers of the AM. Our methods are evaluated in benchmark AMI single distance microphone (SDM) task. We find that the proposed approaches provide 1.6% absolute improvement over a strong sMBR trained LSTM baseline.",0,CHEAT
"Lipreading is a difficult gesture classification task. One problem in computer lipreading is speaker-independence.

Current literature is limited on speaker-independent lipreading, the few independent test speaker accuracy scores are usually aggregated within dependent test speaker accuracies for an averaged performance. This leads to unclear independent results. Here we undertake a systematic survey of experiments with the TCD-TIMIT dataset using both conventional approaches and deep learning methods to provide a series of wholly speaker-independent benchmarks and show that the best speaker-independent machine scores 69.58% accuracy with CNN features and an SVM classifier. This is less than state-of-the-art speaker-dependent lipreading machines, but greater than previously reported in independence experiments.",0,CHEAT
"Variable stiffness actuated (VSA) robots are expected to play an important role in physical human-robot interaction, thanks to their inherent safety features. These systems can control the position and stiffness concurrently by incorporating two or more actuators for each joint. Unfortunately, the need for extra sensors to measure the state of these actuators decreases the reliability of these systems. In this paper, we present a sensor reduction scheme for VSA robots. Specifically, we utilize moving horizon estimation (MHE) to estimate the unmeasured states of the system. Due to its ability to handle constraints, MHE is chosen as the estimation algorithm. The estimated states are then used by a nonlinear model predictive controller to implement a closed-loop control system. In order to show the efficacy of our framework, we conducted extensive simulation and real-world experiments with a reaction wheel augmented VSA system. The objective of these experiments was to compare the control performance of the sensor reduced system (from four encoders to two encoders) with the system using the full set of states for control. The results of these experiments show the feasibility of the MHE-based sensor reduction. Sensor reduction might increase the reliability of VSA robots and might facilitate their earlier introduction to the industrial environments.",0,CHEAT
"Soft robots-robots made of soft materials-have strong potential for applications where traditional rigid robots are not suitable (e.g., safely collaborating with humans). However, actuation methods for most existing soft robots still require rigid components to function, and when they do not, they have a limited range of forces and displacements. A new artificial muscle, Twisted-and-Coiled actuators (TCAs), may provide partial solutions to this. They are capable of producing large forces and deformations comparable to or superior to human muscles. However, the dynamic modeling for TCAs when embedded inside soft materials is not trivial due to the coupling of deformations between the actuators and the body. In this paper, we model the dynamics for the thermally driven actuation and extend a dynamic Cosserat rod model to describe the dynamics of the soft body. We also numerically simulate the model to test its correctness. The proposed model is a generalization of existing models and can be applied to the modeling of soft robots when couplings exist between the actuator and the soft body.",0,CHEAT

The Buck converter is a step down DC-DC converter in which harmonics and power losses are very low as compared to the boost converter. In switching regulators, the output voltage ripples depend upon inductor values, capacitor value, MOSFET switching frequency and duty cycle. This paper focuses on the design and analysis of DC-DC converters for low-power Photovoltaic (PV) energy harvesting applications such as WSN nodes. The simulation work is done using MATLAB software. From the simulation results, it is proved that the output voltage ripples are inversely proportional to the value of the inductor, capacitor and duty cycle.",0,CHEAT

Taking IEEE14 IEEE30 and IEEE57 standard nodes as examples, the data accuracy was improved to the maximum extent with the minimum number of PMU, and the feasibility of the method was verified.",0,CHEAT
"Non-rigid registration is a crucial step for many applications such as motion tracking, model retrieval, and object recognition. The accuracy of these applications is highly dependent on the initial position used in registration step. In this paper we propose a novel Convex Hull Aided Coarse Registration refined by two algorithms applied on projected points. Firstly, the proposed approach uses a statistical method to find the best plane that represents each point cloud. Secondly, all the points of each cloud are projected onto the corresponding planes. Then, two convex hulls are extracted from the two projected point sets and then matched optimally. Next, the non-rigid transformation from the reference to the model is robustly estimated through minimizing the distance between the matched point's pairs of the two convex hulls. Finally, this transformation estimation is refined by two methods. The first one is the refinement of coarse registration by Iterative Closest Point (ICP). The second one consists of the refinement of coarse registration by the Normal Distribution Transform (NDT). An experimental study, carried out on several clouds, shows that the refinement of coarse registration with ICP gives, in the most cases, a better result than refinement with NDT.",0,CHEAT
"Modern vehicles are equipped with multiple sensors that help engineers to automate driving functions as much as possible. Among other types of sensors, these vehicles are equipped with multiple cameras that enable capturing the video data of the surrounding vehicles. These video data can be later used in training deep neural networks that are typically used within the vehicles to detect objects of interest around them. However, before we can use the video data for training, we must annotate them. Nowadays, the annotation process is typically semi-automated, where the initial annotations are added in a datacenter and then fine-tuned by human annotators. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to utilize high performance computing inside the vehicles in order to add initial annotations at the edge, instead of using the datacenter.

"In neurosurgeries, even a small mistake may pose a serious risk to a patient. Hence, a neuronavigation has been used in neurosurgeries to find accurate spatial position of lesion. However, the neuronavigation localizes the lesion based on preoperative medical images, therefore the brain deformation during a surgery, which is referred to as brain shift, has been a serious problem in the neuronavigation. Brain shift occurs in craniotomy and it is caused by gravity, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, and so on. In order to present accurate information on a neuronavigation during surgery, a simple brain shift estimation method is proposed to predict and reproduce intraoperative brain deformation. The proposed method is validated by using a Finite Element (FE) brain model generated from medical images of a real patient. A brain shift simulation using a patient brain model is conducted. The comparison of the simulation result and the intraoperative medical images of the patient show that the simulation can reproduce the brain shift accurately. Most earlier studies have verified their brain shift estimation methods in 2D coordinate by using the 2D medical images. In this study, the accuracy was verified in x-y-z coordinate by using the 3D models.",0,CHEAT
"To address the shortcomings of the evolution of the fragmentation theme and the evolution of the network structure itself in the cooperation network, this paper introduces the ideas and techniques of complex network research. It firstly discovers the whole time-slice network, and then introduces BLPA (Balanced Label Propagation Algorithm) to extract the mobile author nodes and the corresponding community theme and the mobile author node theme based on community discovery. A research method combining vertical theme distribution and horizontal theme evolution is designed to analyze the interaction evolution mechanism or law between theme evolution and community evolution. The experiment found that there are theme differences between different communities in the same time-slice, the mobility of co-workers tends to be dispersed, the mobile author nodes guide the theme change, and the theme evolution driven by community evolution is in line with the overall theme evolution trend. This method makes use of complex network related technologies to explore the intrinsic dynamic mechanism of community evolution, community theme evolution and evolution on DBLP datasets, which is realistically feasible.",0,CHEAT
"Opportunistic Networks, with users as a vital component, appears as a natural evolution of mobile Ad Hoc Networks field, and to some extent, an example of how the Internet of Things work. So, Opportunistic Networks due to their characteristics, need users- centric considerations when it comes to design Opportunistic Networks' routing, privacy, and authentications schemes. However, most mutual authentication schemes proposed for Opportunistic Networks do not consider, on the one hand, the gregarious aspect of users, and on the other hand, the parameter that pre-established contacts could be used in a mutual authentication process. Considering the factors pre-established contacts, Seed OppNet Identity, and traditional cryptography's principles, this paper proposes a realistic multiple levels authentication scheme for short-term and limited-time wireless network environment. The proposed scheme is realistic and achieves anonymity and privacy.",0,CHEAT
"We study a cache-aided content delivery network consisting of a central server which hosts a catalog of N files, and K caches each with limited memory M which store content related to the files. There are K users, each of which requests a file from the catalog, and has access to the data stored in L ≥ 1 neighboring caches (with a cyclic wrap-around). The server transmits a common message to all the users, so that each of them can recover their requested file. This setup was recently studied in [1], where a coloring-based placement and coded-delivery policy was proposed and the required server transmission size was shown to be order-optimal with respect to information-theoretic bounds. We propose an alternate index coding-based placement and delivery scheme for this setup, which performs better than the previously proposed strategy. Furthermore, for multiple special cases including the (N, K ≤ 4, L) and (N, K, L = K - 1)setups, we show that the scheme is exactly optimal under the restriction of uncoded placement. This extends other recent work [2], [3] which studies exact optimality for the single cache-access case (L = 1) to the multi cache-access case (L > 1).",0,CHEAT
"Fast and accurate pose estimation of non-textured 3D objects based on 3D point cloud is emerged as important for the application of vision to industrial automation. There have been proposed a number of global and local 3D geometric features that can be extracted from 3D point cloud. However, they are either too inefficient or too inaccurate to be viable. In this paper, we presents a fast and accurate method of 3D pose estimation based on transforming 3D point cloud into 2D image, where the azimuth and elevation angles of as well as the distance to 3D points are converted to 2D pixels and their image intensities, respectively.

"Cloud computing, together with all its boons, has taken the world of computing by a storm, reaping benefits across various domains. Introduction of serverless computing, and more precisely Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), removed many orchestration and maintenance issues that system designers were facing. This inspired an emerging field of research on utilization and optimization of serverless computing. Existing body of work on this topic is, to the best of authors knowledge, focused on using serverless functions (e.g. AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) exclusively. Such functions suffer constraints in the context of their execution environment, time or available space. In this paper we present a more general approach that improves upon existing architectures that revolve around cloud functions. By leveraging AWS Fargate technology, we propose a fully serverless and infinitely scalable architecture that is based on producer-consumer pattern and can be shaped to satisfy wide range of requirements. As worker nodes, Docker containers are used, which helps avoid aforementioned constrains. This concept is put to use in a system for acquisition of high frequency data.",0,CHEAT
"Wireless sensor systems represent reliable platforms for monitoring and managing of a variety of applications for health care, civil, and military environments. As most of these systems are energy constrained, an accurate control of the energy consumption is required to well design the system. The main focus of this paper is the accurate energy modeling of Wireless Body Area Networks. To this end, we discuss the propagation channel model at 2.4 GHz between two body sensors placed on the human body. This model combines path losses in free space and on human body. Then, an analytical energy consumption model is derived by including channel characteristics such as the proposed path loss model, small scale fading and signal to noise ratio. The model is validated by measurements performed with patch antennas on human subjects. Our results provide interesting insights about the effect of on-body propagation on the global path losses. Moreover, with the proposed approach, the correlation between propagation channel features and energy efficiency is highlighted.",0,CHEAT
"Opportunistic Networks (OppNets) enable communication in highly stressed environments with intermittent connectivity and are categorized by long and variable delays as well as high error rates. The majority of Opportunistic Network routing protocols tend to spread multiple copies of the same message into the network. This process is conditioned by the existence of sufficient buffer capacity and energy in nodes. This paper focuses on the problem of some nodes making no contribution to the network. Selfish nodes consume network resources, reducing its availability and performance, therefore they constitute a real challenge that should be considered. However, most recent Opportunistic Network studies give little consideration to the impact of selfishness on the energy consumption related to Opportunistic Network routing protocols in mobile context. The remaining energy in the node can play a crucial role in its willingness to cooperate in the network. This study includes some new routing protocols such as DLife, SPRAY&FOCUS, PROPHET v2 among others. Our simulations show clearly that SPRAY&WAIT, SPRAY&FOCUS, and DLife protocols consume less energy in cooperative environment and also in selfish environment for the three movement models considered in this study: Random Walk, Random Waypoint, and Cluster model. Moreover, in the EPIDEMIC-like group, our results show that nodes consume energy faster than other routing protocols in both environment (cooperative and selfish).",0,CHEAT
"The edge computing paradigm brings the promise of overcoming the practical scalability limitations of cloud computing, that are a result of the high volume of data produced by Internet of Things (IoT) and other large-scale applications. The principle of edge computing is to move computations beyond the data center, closer to end-user devices where data is generated and consumed. This new paradigm creates the opportunity for edge-enabled systems and applications, that have components executing directly and cooperatively on edge devices. Having systems' components, actively and directly, collaborating in the edge, requires some form of distributed monitoring as to adapt to variable operational conditions. Monitoring requires efficient ways to aggregate information collected from multiple devices. In particular, and considering some IoT applications, monitoring will happen among devices that communicate primarily via wireless channels. In this paper we study the practical performance of several distributed continuous aggregation protocols in the wireless ad hoc setting, and propose a novel protocol that is more precise and robust than competing alternative.",0,CHEAT

"The majority of the control schemes of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine systems for the maximum power capture are dependent on its internal states or functions based on these states. Thus, the availability of these states is required to implement such a control scheme in practical. But sometimes some of the states are not available (measurable) to formulate the control law. Hence, this paper recommends the estimation of such unobservable states to implement the maximum extraction control of DFIG based wind energy conversion system in practice. It is based on the estimation based control of the DFIG for the active power control for MPPT as well as the control of the stator terminal voltage. The estimation of the unobservable states have been carried out by Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), a discrete-time nonlinear estimator. The active power and stator voltage control has been implemented through the rotor flux control approach.",0,CHEAT
"Alternaria leaf spot, Brown spot, Mosaic, Grey spot, and Rust are five common types of apple leaf diseases that severely affect apple yield. However, the existing research lacks an accurate and fast detector of apple diseases for ensuring the healthy development of the apple industry. This paper proposes a deep learning approach that is based on improved convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the real-time detection of apple leaf diseases. In this paper, the apple leaf disease dataset (ALDD), which is composed of laboratory images and complex images under real field conditions, is first constructed via data augmentation and image annotation technologies. Based on this, a new apple leaf disease detection model that uses deep-CNNs is proposed by introducing the GoogLeNet Inception structure and Rainbow concatenation. Finally, under the hold-out testing dataset, using a dataset of 26,377 images of diseased apple leaves, the proposed INAR-SSD (SSD with Inception module and Rainbow concatenation) model is trained to detect these five common apple leaf diseases. The experimental results show that the INAR-SSD model realizes a detection performance of 78.80% mAP on ALDD, with a high-detection speed of 23.13 FPS. The results demonstrate that the novel INAR-SSD model provides a high-performance solution for the early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases that can perform real-time detection of these diseases with higher accuracy and faster detection speed than previous methods.",0,CHEAT

"Delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) are wireless mobile networks where constant end-to-end connections may not exist among nodes. In real-life vehicle DTNs, most nodes have repetitive movement patterns. However, due to the change of time and different activity scenarios, the movement patterns cannot be described consistently with a single model. Considering this issue, the Multi-period Bayesian Network (MBN) is proposed to build multiple prediction models, which intends to predict the regular movement patterns of nodes in the real world. The Bayesian network model is constructed by using several network parameters (e.g. spatial and temporal information at the time of message forwarding) to describe the movement patterns of DTN nodes. Additionally, a novel classification method called Dynamic Multiple-Level Classification (DMLC), is proposed where nodes are classified into multiple levels according to the dynamic parameters. Followed by that, a routing algorithm based on MBN is presented, which can make routing decisions based on the classification results of DMLC. The simulation results show that MBN algorithm and DMLC method can improve the delivery ratio with a minor forwarding overhead.",0,CHEAT
"Fingerprint liveness detection has gradually been regarded as a primary countermeasure for protecting the fingerprint recognition systems from spoof presentation attacks. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown impressive performance and great potential in advancing the state-of-the-art of fingerprint liveness detection. However, most existing CNNs-based fingerprint liveness methods have a few shortcomings: 1) the CNN structure used on natural images does not achieve good performance on fingerprint liveness detection, which neglects the inevitable differences between natural images and fingerprint images; or 2) a relative shallow architecture (typically several layers) has not paid attention to the capability of deep network for spoof fingerprint detection. Motivated by the compelling classification accuracy and desirable convergence behaviors of the deep residual network, this paper proposes a new CNN-based fingerprint liveness detection framework to discriminate between live fingerprints and fake ones. The proposed framework is a lightweight yet powerful network structure, called Slim-ResCNN, which consists of the stack of series of improved residual blocks. The improved residual blocks are specifically designed for fingerprint liveness detection without overfitting and less processing time. The proposed approach significantly improves the performance of fingerprint liveness detection on LivDet2013 and LivDet2015 datasets. Additionally, the Slim-ResCNN wins the first prize in the Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition 2017, with an overall accuracy of 95.25%.",0,CHEAT

To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Resource Allocation method, named DRA in this paper, for load-balance task scheduling. Technically, the method is consisted of four steps that are enacted in a hierarchical control framework. The proposed method has been validated its feasibility and efficiency by extensive experiments comparing with the other two outstanding methods.",0,CHEAT
"The wide diffusion of information in social networks can be exploited to solve searching-for-a-target (SFT) problems including those of missing individuals. Incentive mechanisms that promote active individual participation can be designed to favor a clear propagation direction to help efficiently find a target. However, the existing incentive research rarely focuses on a clear propagation direction based on a specific goal. Thus, we propose an effective contribution-driven information propagation incentive mechanism (IPIM) that exploits ego networks to solve the SFT problem. First, we use an all-pay auction-inspired model to determine the propagation of alters in each ego network. We then propose a novel algorithm, the node propagation utility, based on effective contributions, to focus the propagation toward the target rather than searching indiscriminately and inefficiently. The theoretical analyses and simulation results indicate that IPIM guarantees the truthfulness, individual rationality, and budget feasibility. The simulations are conducted based on real and public social datasets. The IPIM shows increased efficiencies of 951.18 % of success rate, of 215.65 % in propagation hops, and of 514.41 % in participation scale, compared with a typical incentive mechanism. In conclusion, the IPIM shows significant value in the potential application in SFT.",0,CHEAT
"This paper presents a fast, high-precision, and fully automatic windowing method based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Displaying a magnetic resonance (MR) image with a data depth of 12/16 bits on regular 8-bit monitors usually needs a windowing process to remap the full range of pixel intensity to a subrange. However, adaptively and automatically adjusting the windowing parameters of MR images under various viewing conditions is a challenging problem in medical image processing due to the low contrast and high grayscale range. We present a novel method based on the deep CNN's to estimate the windowing parameters that can match the adjustment of human experts precisely and quickly. The network acts as a typical end-to-end mapping function that takes the raw pixels of the MR images as input and directly outputs the corresponding estimation of the optimal windowing parameters. To speed up the inference, we utilize a space-to-depth (STD) conversion to reduce the spatial resolution of input images, and thus the computing burden of the inference process. The extensive experiments on the dataset annotated by clinicians show that the proposed method can accurately predict the optimal windowing parameters of an MR image with a size of 1024×1024 in less than 0.01 s. Due to the high effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method, it is highly applicable for various clinical and research purposes.",0,CHEAT

"Prediction of bus travel time and/or delay time is a useful tool for passengers who want to plan their journey, e.g., when they should leave from the origin bus stop, what they will do after arriving at the destination bus stop, and so on. Many studies have tackled this task using probe data and/or the real time data provided by automatic vehicle location (AVL) systems. Most of them only targeted a small number of routes, short time periods, e.g. less than one week, and used few machine learning models to evaluate their methods. However, different routes generally show different characteristics. In fact, there are big differences between urban routes and rural routes. Furthermore, the performance of machine learning models also varies according to the data dealt with by the models. In this paper, we propose prediction models for bus delay over all intervals between pairs of adjacent bus stops. To build the models, we use one month of bus probe data, which includes more than 80 routes, and apply several machine learning models: linear regression (LR), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the GBDT-based prediction model and the effects of considering travel time over prior intervals.",0,CHEAT

"Objective: The diversity of tissue structure in histopathological images makes feature extraction for classification a challenging task. Dictionary learning within a sparse representation-based classification (SRC) framework has been shown to be successful for feature discovery. However, there exist stiff practical challenges: 1) computational complexity of SRC can be onerous in the decision stage since it involves solving a sparsity constrained optimization problem and often over a large number of image patches; and 2) images from distinct classes continue to share several geometric features. We propose a novel analysis-synthesis model learning with shared features algorithm (ALSF) for classifying such images more effectively. Methods: In the ALSF, a joint analysis and synthesis learning model is introduced to learn the classifier and the feature extractor at the same time. Unlike SRC, no explicit optimization is needed in the inference phase leading to much reduced computation. Crucially, we introduce the learning of a low-rank shared dictionary and a shared analysis operator, which more accurately represents both similarities and differences in histopathological images from distinct classes. We also develop an extension of ALSF with a sparsity constraint, whose presence or absence facilitates a cost-performance tradeoff. Results: The ALSF is evaluated on three challenging and well-known datasets: 1) spleen tissue images; 2) brain tumor images; and 3) breast cancer tissue dataset, provided by different organizations. Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate both complexity and performance benefits of the ALSF over state-of-the-art alternatives. Significance: Modeling shared features with appropriate quantitative constraints lead to significantly improved classification in histopathology.",0,CHEAT
"Today, many of the aid systems deployed for visually impaired people are mostly made for a single purpose. Be it navigation, object detection, or distance perceiving.

"Software defined networking (SDN) has re-defined the way data center networks are deployed and functioned. The ability to separate the control plane and data plane have led to the simpler design and easier management. In SDN, the data plane and control plane are separately managed, so building an additional wired network to connect the control plane and the data plane can lead to a high cabling complexity. This paper proposes an end-to-end end wireless control plane architecture for SDN-enabled data center networks. In the proposed architecture, the switches form clusters that are wirelessly connected to the controller via access points (APs) and relay nodes (RNs). The switches use the 2.4/5-GHz band to connect with the APs, whereas the APs and the RNs are connected to the controller using the 60-GHz band. We have presented an analytical model to derive achievable data rates in our wireless control plane. We have also proposed two algorithms that allow an optimal number of a cluster size of the switches to be connected with the Controller via minimum number to APs/RNs such that the control traffic demands of the switches is guaranteed in interference constrained environment. Through extensive simulations, the results of our proposed architecture show that the cabling complexity in the control plane is reduced to zero and additional switches may be easily added in SDN data center. Thus, a pure wireless solution for building a control plane in a data center network is feasible.",0,CHEAT

"Recently, the wireless sensor networks (WSNs) technology has increasingly become a promising tool for information collection, transmission and processing.

"In this paper, we propose a face super-resolution (FSR) method to handle the decreasing face recognition rate caused by low-quality images. To better model the input images, we build a nearest neighbor network (NNN) which consists of nodes and paths by introducing the second-layer nearest neighbors (SLNNs), where the paths of the network represent the distance between nodes. As the SLNN is trained in the high-resolution (HR) space and is exponentially supplementary to the traditional first-layer nearest neighbors (FLNNs), the neighbor inadequacy problem can be effectively solved by enriching the neighbor candidate set via NNN. Furthermore, we solve the NNN for the optimal weights of neighbors. Finally, we fuse the refined weights and neighbors for better reconstruction results. The effectiveness of this fusion strategy is validated by both quantitative and qualitative experimental results. The extensive experimental results on the public face datasets and real-world challenging low-resolution (LR) images demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.",0,CHEAT
"For missile's accuracy assessment, an accurate separation about the guidance of systematic errors is a critical part. Based on the vehicles from a mobile launcher platform, this paper proposes a nonlinear error separation model and a corresponding method in consideration of the ill-conditioning of the environmental function matrix, and the coupling of the guidance instrumental errors and the initial errors. The nonlinear model is built in combination with the tracking data. For the error separation problem with ill-conditioning, the traditional nonlinear methods can only slightly weaken the degree of ill-conditioning rather than solve it. To address this issue, this paper puts forward a novel guidance systematic error separation method based on the artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA).

Along with this process there is another topical issue of forming appropriate competences of the research and teaching university staff, including professors, teachers, and researchers. The notions of “competence” and “competence approach”, formulated by the leading scholars in this area (R.I.Akmaeva, A.A.Dulzon, V.N.Gurov, G.M.Zarakovskiy), are investigated. The original model of competences, elaborated for the research and teaching university staff, is shown; it is a complex of personal, social, ethical, and professional competences of workers. The article pays a special attention to the analysis of professional competences, which are presented by the competences in general education, as well as the competences in the educational, methodical, and research areas. The professional competences in accordance with the principles of systematic analysis are analyzed up to the third level; however the degree of specification should depend on goals of a certain organization which will use the method in its activity. It is efficient to form and use the model of competences of the research and teaching university staff in order to have a useful instrument for building the system of staff's assessment.",0,CHEAT
"In order to alleviate the impacts of the rapid network energy exhaustion and the unreliable links on the data gathering in the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile intelligent computing based on compressive sensing date gathering (MIC-CSDG) algorithm is proposed in this paper, which could improve the data reconstruction accuracy. We conduct research from the following four links. First, this method employs mobile intelligent computing to derive the multi-hop function among sensor nodes, which is further utilized to determine the proportional relationship for the sensor nodes. Second, based on the sparse matrix, an observation matrix is designed with low correlation to mitigate the influences of the data packet loss on the entire IoT system and improve the data reconstruction accuracy for the sink node. Then, the acknowledge mechanism for the data forwarding strategy is employed to improve the reliability of the data transmission among clusters. Therefore, reliable data handover is accomplished for the multi-path routing data among different nodes. The results which are about the simulation shows that the loss rate of the packet is equal to 40%, the data reconstruction error of the MIC-CSDG algorithm still remains lower than 5%. Compared with other existing algorithms, the data forwarding time is reduced by 16.36%, while the average network energy consumption is reduced by 23.59%. Therefore, the validity and efficiency of the proposed method are verified.",0,CHEAT
"Due to the advent of Internet of Things(IoT) plethora of services has been emerged and to perpetuate all these services using cloud computing paradigm is really tiresome. A new promising service provider called as Fog computing came into the picture where the distance between Iot and edge device is small to provide the services efficiently to the end users. There are different considerable factors like service response time, and expected QoS must met without violating other resource constraints. In this paper we try to layout an architecture which is based on the combination of cloud and fog by introducing a middleware called as cloud fog control middleware, which manages the service request according to some constraints. By using this architecture we can maximize the advantages of next generation computer system, however the architecture require new strategies to manage the mapping of services to resources. Despite several Heuristic and Meta Heuristic techniques has been proposed by different authors to solve the service placement in fog computing with considering different parameters like quality of service(QoS), Latency, etc. In this paper we are trying to minimize the energy consumption in fog computing paradigm by formulating the service placement plan in order to utilize the resources efficiently by considering the Active and Idle state of machine. First we calculate the energy consumption by the application(number of tasks) requesting for a particular service. Undoubtedly the service placement problem is a combinatorial optimization problem. The optimal solution obtained distribute the load to some other fog node by appropriate placement of service which leads to reduce the over heat generated by a particular fog node. In this way we can achieve energy minimization in fog computing.",0,CHEAT
"The Internet of Things is a network of smart sensors that can control and monitor things from anywhere over the Internet. This smart system can be used to improve the productivity and quality of modern farming. Therefore, the present research aimed to propose a smart farming application powered by the Internet of Things. In this research, the prototype of a smart capsule was developed to measure the humidity in paddy bags stored in various locations within a warehouse. This smart capsule used Node MCU ESP8266 microcontroller and the SHT21 humidity sensor to send data to the Blynk server over a Wi-Fi network. Arduino IDE was used to write a C++ code for the microcontroller. The Blynk mobile application was used to monitor and display real-time humidity data through the digital dashboard. The collected humidity data were further analyzed and used to develop a paddy storage system for the future. In addition, when the smart capsule lost contact with the Blynk server, a notification was sent to responsible persons in a timely manner.

"In distributed environments, where unknown entities cooperate to achieve complex goals, intelligent techniques for estimating agents' truthfulness are required. Distributed Reputation Management Systems (RMSs) allow to accomplish this task without the need for a central entity that may represent a bottleneck and a single point of failure. The design of a distributed RMS is a challenging task due to a multitude of factors that could impact on its performances. In order to support the researcher in evaluating the RMS robustness against security attacks since its beginning design phase, in this work we present a distributed simulation environment that allows to model both the agent's behaviors and the logic of the RMS itself. Moreover, in order to compare at simulation time the performance of the designed distributed RMS with a baseline obtained by an ideal RMS, we introduce an omniscient process called truth-holder which owns a global knowledge all involved entities. The effectiveness of our platform was proved by a set of experiments aimed at measuring the vulnerability of a RMS to a common set of security attacks.",0,CHEAT
"Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming increasingly popular, and wireless cable replacements unleash the user of VR Head Mounted Displays (HMD) from the rendering desktop computer. However, the price to pay for additional freedom of movement is a higher sensitivity of the wireless solution to temporal disturbances of both video frame and input traffic delivery, as compared to its wired counterpart. This paper reports on the development of a test-bed to be used for studying temporal delivery issues of both video frames and input traffic in a wireless VR environment, here using TPCAST with a HTC Vive headset. We provide a solution for monitoring and recording of traces of (1) video frame freezes as observed on the wireless VR headset, and (2) input traffic from the headset and hand controls to the rendering computer. So far, the test-bed illustrates the resilience of the underlying WirelessHD technology and TCP connections that carry the input traffic, and will be used in future studies of Quality of Experience (QoE) in wireless desktop VR.",0,CHEAT
"Network attacks have become a growing threat to the current Internet. For the enhancement of network security and accountability, it is urgent to find the origin and identity of the adversary who misbehaves in the network. Some studies focus on embedding users' identities into IPv6 addresses, but such design cannot support the Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) protocol which is widely deployed nowadays. In this paper, we propose SDN-Ti, a general solution to traceback and identification for attackers in IPv6 networks based on Software Defined Network (SDN). In our proposal, the SDN switch performs a translation between the source IPv6 address of the packet and its trusted ID-encoded address generated by the SDN controller. The network administrator can effectively identify the attacker by parsing the malicious packets when the attack incident happens. Our solution not only avoids the heavy storage overhead and time synchronism problems, but also supports multiple IPv6 address assignment scenarios. What's more, SDN-Ti does not require any modification on the end device, hence can be easily deployed. We implement SDN-Ti prototype and evaluate it in a real IPv6 testbed. Experiment results show that our solution only brings very little extra performance cost, and it shows considerable performance in terms of latency, CPU consumption and packet loss compared to the normal forwarding method. The results indicate that SDN-Ti is feasible to be deployed in practice with a large number of users.",0,CHEAT
"The energy efficiency in multi-tier heterogeneous 5G networks is a critical issue due to the fact that the macro base stations (BSs) power consumption is considerably high and proportional to their traffic load. Traffic offloading from macrocells to small cells is envisioned as a potential solution to improve energy efficiency in 5G heterogeneous networks. However, traffic offloading causes traffic congestion at small cells, interference as a result of small cells transmissions, and aggregate power consumption of small cells. These factors make the traffic offloading procedure more challenging. In this paper, we propose a conditional traffic offloading scheme, which relies on macrocells and small cells system load information to determine the most energy efficient traffic offloading strategy, select the proper operation mode of small cells, and fulfill macro users applications' quality of service (QoS) requirements. The proposed scheme is developed using a novel intuitive online reinforcement learning methodology to perform the conditional traffic offloading in which each macro BS conjectures the offloading strategies of other macrocells. The convergence of the proposed scheme is proved and numerical results demonstrate its capability to achieve fast convergence with QoS guarantee and significant energy efficiency.",0,CHEAT
"In space communications, there exist two prominent issues: large Doppler spread and limited pilot resources, which will result in poor performance for a pilot-aided (PA) traditional carrier synchronization mode (TCSM) with serial processing. In view of this, we propose a frequency-phase decoupling method (FPDM) based on an unbiased auto-correlation (AC) operator with a variable correlation delay length. By using this method, a new carrier synchronization mode (NCSM) is developed with parallel processing. Taking the classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimation as an example, both theoretical analysis and simulation results show that considering a modified generalized frame format: 1) the resulting NCSM can implement decoupling of the frequency offset estimator (FOE) and the phase offset estimator (POE) and 2) the POE of the NCSM achieves stronger ability of anti-Doppler spread and requires less complex multiplication operations compared to that of the TCSM.",0,CHEAT

"Offshore platform has long been in a complex and time-varying marine environment, would be inevitably influenced by environmental load and accidental loading, and result in the occurrence of various kinds of accidents or even disasters. The risk assessment for ocean platform has become an important issue in marine engineering field. However, the quantitative calculation of risks in the marine engineering industry is extremely difficult. The reason may attribute to the fact that there are few relevant statistical databases; and the mechanism of collision damage of marine structures is complex. The numerical simulation of impact caused by falling object is carried out by nonlinear finite element method (FEM). The PLS-RBF network is used for nonlinear interpolation purpose by combining the partial least square regression with the radial basis function (RBF) neural network. Therefore, the trained network can be implemented to obtain accurate collision results under various conditions by nonlinear interpolation. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed mapping approach for nonlinear finite analysis are testified by the simulation validation.",0,CHEAT

"Urban farming as enhanced by the latest cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies may possibly give a promising direction to solve the global issue of food crisis. This work-in-progress paper describes a group of 13 Engineering students from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) working closely with 35 Science students from the Dagon University (DU) in Myanmar through an experiential project to investigate thoroughly on the challenging topic of urban farming with a number of carefully designed field trips, seminars, training workshops and other interesting activities.

Despite the detection of accurate symmetries, the algorithm can also provide accurate, intuitive and stable measurements of the detected symmetries. A hierarchical strategy is applied to speed up the algorithm, and the algorithm can detect symmetries in high resolutions very efficiently by reusing computational results that are yielded in low resolutions.",0,CHEAT
"With the continuous progress of the space station project, the rotary mechanism is widely used in the space station. Serious failure of rotating mechanism can cause motor burnout and then safety problems. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor and diagnose rotating mechanism. The vibration signal of the rotating mechanism is nonlinear and non-stationary. Therefore, the acceleration sensor vibration signal is decomposed by CEEMD method to get the intrinsic mode function. Next, Fourier transform is used to obtain time-frequency information according to the obvious components of fault characteristics, and the information entropy of time-frequency information is calculated. The degree of dimensionality reduction about fault feature is determined by selecting the number of principal components through adaptive cumulative contribution. Finally, the fault feature is trained by support vector machine and tested with data. Experimental results show that the optimized method is less computational and can accurately extract fault feature information.",0,CHEAT
"In many real-world applications, an object can be described from multiple views or styles, leading to the emerging multi-view analysis. To eliminate the complicated (usually highly nonlinear) view discrepancy for favorable cross-view recognition and retrieval, we propose a Multi-view Linear Discriminant Analysis Network (MvLDAN) by seeking a nonlinear discriminant and view-invariant representation shared among multiple views. Unlike existing multi-view methods which directly learn a common space to reduce the view gap, our MvLDAN employs multiple feedforward neural networks (one for each view) and a novel eigenvalue-based multi-view objective function to encapsulate as much discriminative variance as possible into all the available common feature dimensions. With the proposed objective function, the MvLDAN could produce representations possessing: 1) low variance within the same class regardless of view discrepancy, 2) high variance between different classes regardless of view discrepancy, and 3) high covariance between any two views. In brief, in the learned multi-view space, the obtained deep features can be projected into a latent common space in which the samples from the same class are as close to each other as possible (even though they are from different views), and the samples from different classes are as far from each other as possible (even though they are from the same view). The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by extensive experiments carried out on five databases, in comparison with the 19 state-of-the-art approaches.",0,CHEAT

"One of the major obstacles to achieving routine deployment of small cells is the lack of generally available sources of power for the vast number of sites. Wireless service providers (WSPs) and neutral hosts design small cell networks based on RF coverage which, unfortunately, does not always coincide with an easily accessed source of power. Even when small cells are deployed on light poles, municipalities may not allow the wireless service provider access to the AC power present at the pole. An emerging solution to this problem is to power the sites using Network Power, wherein a centralized source of power is distributed to the small cell sites over copper cables. The Network Power solution typically consists of a source of power housed in an Outside Plant electronics cabinet that is equipped with power conversion devices, batteries (if backup is required), and OSP connection and protection to enable access to the copper cables. At the small cell site, a compact power conversion device is required to deliver the right voltage and power levels to the small cell. There are two different types of Network Power; Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC) network using Coaxial Cable and Remote Line Power using Twisted Pair Copper Cable. For the past 40 years, Network Power using Coaxial Cables have been deployed by MSOs (Multiple System Operators) in the CATV industry to energize cascades of RF amplifiers and nodes for the coax portion of the HFC network. Similarly, wireline service providers have utilized Remote Line Power using Twisted Pair Copper Cables for powering Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) and Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) networks. The medium used to deliver Network Power whether it be twisted pair copper cable or coaxial cable is dependent on the network architecture and what is accessible to the service provider. Though wireless small cell service providers by their very nature do not have existing copper cables to deliver the power, Network Power is a viable option that is rapidly becoming the preferred method for meeting the providers' broad distribution plans and tight deployment schedules. There are three ways to address the lack of existing cables: (1) install new OSP copper cables alongside the fiber backhaul cable; (2) work with the local wireline carrier to use available capacity in its existing twisted pair copper network; and (3) work with the local cable TV company to use its existing coax cable network. The twisted pair copper cable and the cable TV coax cable require different power solutions to deliver the right voltage and power to the small cell, but the general concept is similar - deliver the right voltage and power to the small cell device(s) from a source located hundreds of meters away.This paper presents how Network Power works over both twisted pair and coax networks. It defines the network architectures for both approaches, as well as describes both the source and small cell power components. The paper concludes by summarizing the key attributes of each technique.",0,CHEAT
"Transparent object segmentation can be very useful in computer vision applications. However, because the transparent objects borrow texture from their background and have a similar appearance to their surroundings, they are not handled well by regular image segmentation methods. In this paper, we propose a method that overcomes these problems using the consistency and distortion properties in a light-field image. The light-field linearity is used to estimate the likelihood of a pixel belonging to the transparent object or Lambertian background, and the occlusion detector is used to find the occlusion boundary. Graph-cut optimization is applied for the pixel labeling problem. We acquire light field datasets from both camera array and lenslet camera for the transparent object, and use these datasets to evaluate our method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully segments transparent objects from the background under various conditions.",0,CHEAT
"In many applications, source nodes send the sensing information of the monitored objects and the sinks receive the transmitted data. Considering the limited resources of sensor nodes, location privacy preservation becomes an important issue. Although many schemes are proposed to preserve source or sink location security, few schemes can preserve the location security of source nodes and sinks. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel of multi-branch source location privacy protection method based on random walk. This method hides the location of real source nodes by setting multiple proxy sources. And multiple neighbors are randomly selected by the real source node as receivers until a proxy source receives the packet. In addition, the proxy source is chosen randomly, which can prevent the attacker from obtaining the location-related data of the real source node. At the same time, the scheme sets up a branch interference area around the base station to interfere with the adversary by increasing routing branches. Simulation results describe that our scheme can efficiently protect source and sink location privacy, reduce the communication overhead, and prolong the network lifetime.",0,CHEAT

"In this paper, a novel unsupervised deep learning approach is proposed to tackle the multiuser frequency synchronization problem inherent in orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) uplink communications. The key idea lies in the use of the feed-forward deep neural network (FF-DNN) for multiuser interference (MUI) cancellation taking advantage of their strong classification capability. Basically, the proposed FF-DNN consists of two essential functional layers. One is called carrier-frequency-offsets (CFOs) classification layer that is responsible for identifying the users' CFO range, and another is called MUI-cancellation layer responsible for joint multiuser detection (MUD) and frequency synchronization. By such means, the proposed FF-DNN approach showcases remarkable MUI-cancellation performances without the need of multiuser CFO estimation. In addition, we also exhibit an interesting phenomenon occurred at the CFO-classification stage, where the CFO-classification performance get improved exponentially with the increase of the number of users. This is called multiuser diversity gain in the CFO-classification stage, which is carefully studied in this paper.",0,CHEAT

The results show that FBM is a better solution than PBM because it has lower false positive rate when true positive rate is high. Also FBM can provide lower overhead because PBM spends 123% time over FBM on establishing the MLP model.",0,CHEAT

"Cardiac Arrhythmia is a serious and common cardiovascular disease. Electrocardiographic signal (ECG) is usually used for diagnosis.

"In order to achieve efficient and accurate sensing coverage of water reservoirs and 3D ocean bodies in near real time, in this paper a novel adaptive sampling strategy using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is introduced. The vehicles capture the spatial distribution of the specific manifestations-such as salinity, temperature, potential Hydrogen (pH), chlorophyll concentration-of the phenomenon in the field of interest with the help of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms for navigation. To enable adaptive sampling with the required accuracy, the vehicles, i.e., mobile nodes, need to adjust continuously their trajectories with the help of an external platform-the static nodes on the surface-based on the sampling information gathered by the on-board sensors and also on the localization information provided by the Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF) algorithm. Experiments were conducted on a mobile robot and a static surface node to verify the proposed solution. In the original scheme, the robot was connected to the user via a tether; instead, we use an onboard controller to perform adaptive sampling autonomously underwater, and on the water surface via wireless connection to the static node as the remote processor.",0,CHEAT

"Though generative adversarial networks (GANs) can hallucinate high-quality high-resolution (HR) faces from low-resolution (LR) faces, they cannot ensure identity preservation during face hallucination, making the HR faces difficult to recognize. To address this problem, we propose a Siamese GAN (SiGAN) to reconstruct HR faces that visually resemble their corresponding identities. On top of a Siamese network, the proposed SiGAN consists of a pair of two identical generators and one discriminator. We incorporate reconstruction error and identity label information in the loss function of SiGAN in a pairwise manner. By iteratively optimizing the loss functions of the generator pair and the discriminator of SiGAN, we not only achieve visually-pleasing face reconstruction but also ensure that the reconstructed information is useful for identity recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that SiGAN significantly outperforms existing face hallucination GANs in objective face verification performance while achieving promising visual-quality reconstruction. Moreover, for input LR faces with unseen identities that are not part of the training dataset, SiGAN can still achieve reasonable performance.",0,CHEAT

"The research in non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has led to significant improvements in the recent years. However, the user experience and the BCI illiteracy problem remain key issues to address for obtaining robust and resilient applications. In this paper, we address the choice of the time segment for the detection of steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) detection. The choice of this parameter is typically fixed and has a direct influence on the accuracy of detection, and therefore the information transfer rate. We propose to shift the problem of the time segment to the choice of the threshold for determining if a response has been properly detected. We consider an open-dataset of 10 participants to validate the rationale of the approach. The results support the conclusion that an adaptive time segment can lead to a better ITR on average across participants compared to a fixed time segment equal to the average of the mean adapted time segment for each subject. The ITR increases from 68.87 to 75.39 bpm with 12 targets, and from 54.20 to 72.66 bpm with 6 targets, highlighting the need of adaptive methods.",0,CHEAT
"Predicting accurate efforts at the early stages of the Software Life Cycle is one of the greatest challenges in software industry. Effort estimation remains a very difficult task since the software requirements are not well known and understood/or the details have not yet been specified. Thus, most of software effort estimation models are built on using historical project data. For this purpose, CBR based prediction models have been extensively used. In CBR techniques, choosing the most similar case has a strong impact on the prediction accuracy, nevertheless, it remains a hard task especially on the presence of alternatives projects; projects that are equally similar. This paper proposed a new method to select the most appropriate case by using ant colony optimization algorithm. The ACO algorithm will be used to search for the best case of past cases based on the different features similarity values (FR_similarity, NFRs_similarity and DPs_similarity). To verify the efficiency and performance of the proposed model, an example was conducted and the results were compared with that of the real estimation. The results of the example show that proposed model in this paper is an attractive alternative to retrieve the most appropriate case and is useful and beneficial for decision making during the effort estimation.",0,CHEAT
"Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is providing cloud computing capabilities within the radio access networks and offering a new paradigm to liberate the mobile devices from heavy computational workloads. Importantly, MEC can effectively reduce latency, avoid congestion, and prolong the battery lifetime of mobile devices by offloading the computation tasks from the mobile devices to a physically proximal MEC servers. Particularly, Virtual Machines (VMs) scheduling is a critical issue for tasks offloading and computation in MEC. Regarding to the VMs scheduling problem in MEC environmnet, this paper pioneers the use of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) methodology for identifying the mapping from tasks to VMs. Specifically, the VMs profile and tasks descriptions are initially characterized as the formal contexts, respectively. With the constructed formal contexts, the corresponding formal concepts which refer to the rules set, are then generated. To better infuse the rules set of VMs and tasks, this paper defines a similarity measurement between formal concepts of VMs and tasks. Consequently, the matching problem from a given task to a virtual machine is to return the expected virtual machine according to the principle of maximum similarity degree between formal concepts of virtual machine and task. Extensive simulations are conducted with a real dataset for the validation of feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Specifically, the proposed approach can significantly reduce the energy consumption around 28 percent comparing to the approach without consideration of energy consumption. Overall, It is demonstrated that FCA-based VMs scheduling is a novel solution for a sustainable VMs scheduling in MEC environment.",0,CHEAT

"Nearly 35% of passenger vehicle accident deaths are from rollover crashes. In vehicle stability control system, the active rollover prevention is presented to prevent rollovers. An imminent rollover should be detected immediately through accurate and reliable detection for active vehicle rollover prevention. A traditional rollover index is able to detect un-tripped rollovers. However, it fails to detect tripped rollovers from external inputs such as tripping by the force of a vehicle striking a curb or a road bump. Thus, a new neural network algorithm to detect both tripped and un-tripped rollovers is needed so any estimation algorithms to determine unknown parameters will no longer be used. The neural network algorithm uses multi-variables from available sensors on the vehicle to calculate and categorize the rollover warning into 3 levels: “Safe”, “Low Risk”, and “High Risk”. Moreover, the algorithm can detect both tripped and un-tripped rollover by testing with a 1/5th scaled vehicle. In order to show dynamic similarity between the 1/5th scale vehicle and a full-sized vehicle, the Buckingham π theorem is used. From experiment results, it is clear that the neural network algorithm can be used to accurately enable the rollover warning for the tripped and un-tripped rollover.",0,CHEAT
"This paper proposes a novel gradient descent least squares regression (GDLSR)-based neural network (NN) structure for the control of grid-integrated solar photovoltaic (PV) system with improved power quality. Here, a single-layer neuron structure is used for the extraction of fundamental component (FC) from the load current. During FC extraction, GDLSR-based NN structure attenuates harmonic components, noise, dc offsets, bias, notches and distortions from the nonlinear current, which improves the power quality under normal as well as under abnormal grid conditions. This single-layer GDLSR-based NN structure has a very simple architecture, which decreases the computational burden and algorithm complexity. Therefore, it is easy in implementation. In this work, the GDLSR-based control technique is tested on a single-phase single-stage grid-integrated PV topology with the nonlinear loads. The prime objective of the GDLSR-based NN structure is to provide reactive power compensation, power factor correction, harmonics filtering and mitigation of other power quality issues. Moreover, when solar irradiation is zero, the dc-link capacitor and voltage-source converter act as a distribution static compensator, which enhances the utilization factor of the system. The proposed system is modeled, and its performances are verified experimentally on a developed prototype in different grid disturbances as well as solar insolation variation conditions, which performances have satisfied the motive of the proposed technique as well as the IEEE-519 standard.",0,CHEAT
"This paper presents the deployment of the security testing and evaluation (ST&E), and classifications of common internal threats on a network access layer.

Therefore, this paper highlights two techniques to test the network security, especially on the very limited permission access in order to identify the characteristic of threats on the access layer network. The empirical studies result achieved by syslog and (Switched Port Analyzer) SPAN protocol configuration technique. It is demonstrated that the attack can be done on the access layer.

"The system in which wireless device self configure, establish and communicate from one end to the other using wireless channel with no existing fixed network is known as Mobile ad hoc network (MANET). The MANET is another varient of Ad-hoc network, which creates short-lived network using wirelss mobile devices. In ddition to MANET, the behaviour of this kind of temporary networks depends on routing protocols. The large number of routing techniques has been presented in the literature, but it is also been stated that routing is one of the key research issue even till today.

"MEC is an emerging paradigm that utilizes computing resources at the network edge to deploy heterogeneous applications and services. In the MEC system, mobile users and enterprises can offload computation-intensive tasks to nearby computing resources to reduce latency and save energy. When users make offloading decisions, the task dependency needs to be considered. Due to the NP-hardness of the offloading problem, the existing solutions are mainly heuristic, and therefore have difficulties in adapting to the increasingly complex and dynamic applications. To address the challenges of task dependency and adapting to dynamic scenarios, we propose a new DRL-based offloading framework, which can efficiently learn the offloading policy uniquely represented by a specially designed S2S neural network. The proposed DRL solution can automatically discover the common patterns behind various applications so as to infer an optimal offloading policy in different scenarios. Simulation experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed DRL-based method with different data transmission rates and task numbers. The results show that our method outperforms two heuristic baselines and achieves nearly optimal performance.",0,CHEAT

Then, we propose a robust divide-and-conquer absolute scale estimation method based on the ground plane and camera height by analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches. By using the estimated scale, an effective scale correction strategy has been proposed to reduce the scale drift during the monocular visual odometry estimation process. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method have been verified on both public and self-collected image sequences.",0,CHEAT
"Task deployment has become a hot topic for load balancing in edge computing. In view of the problem that most of the hosts are overloaded in the edge computing, the central load is unbalanced. Much work focuses on the load balancing of the cloud data center or the short-term load balancing of edge data centers. In order to solve the host selection problem of task deployment in joint cloud data centers with edge computing while achieving the overall long-term load balancing, this paper utilizes that the deployment mode of joint cloud model, on this basis, proposes a deployment strategy HEELS based on the analysis of heuristic task clustering method and glowworm swarm optimization algorithm. Its main idea consists of two parts. First, the task with large resources in the current task set is filtered out by the clustering analysis, and the task offloading technology is exploited to upload the result to the cloud computing center for deployment and calculation. Then, the optimized GSO algorithm is exploited in the edge computing center, and the idea of SCA is combined into the optimization of step size so that the optimized GSO algorithm has an adaptive step size, achieving better global search ability in the early stage and better local convergence ability in the later stage. The experimental results show that compared with the existing research, HEELS realizes better load balancing effect and makes the joint datacenter more green and efficient.",0,CHEAT
The communication network under consideration consists of two stations: a single-server queuing system with non-stationary arrivals of packets and an unobserved stochastic channel with finite number of states. The service rate being proportional to the controlled transmission rate depends on the channel state. The probability of packet loss increases as the queue load becomes higher or the channel state worsens. The goal of the problem is to choose the transmission rate to minimize both packet losses and signal energy. The solution is based on visualization of Pareto optimal control policies with incomplete information. Two estimators (optimal filter and current queue state) and two operations (expectation and mode) are used to track changes in the stochastic channel. Computer simulation results are presented to compare the controls obtained.,0,CHEAT

On this basis, we then build a Back Propagation Neural Network-based prediction model to predict recipients of the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China in the field of computer science. The experimental results of precision rate, recall rate and F1 prove that this model has good performance in award prediction. In addition to the methodological contribution, our research can not only help scholars get a better understanding of underlying mechanism contained in academic achievements, but also provide them with the support and guidance to manage their academic careers.",0,CHEAT
"Speaker recognition is a technique used to automatically recognize a speaker from a recording of their voice or speech utterance. Speaker recognition technology has improved over recent years and has become inexpensive and and reliable method for person identification and verification. Research in the field of speaker recognition has now spanned over five decades and has shown fruitful results, however there is not much work done with regards to South African indigenous languages.

"Vascular access dysfunction is the leading cause of hospitalization for hemodialysis patients and accounts for the most medical costs in this patient population. Vascular access flow is commonly hindered by blood vessel narrowing (stenosis). Current screening methods involving imaging to detect stenosis are too costly for routine use at the point of care. Noninvasive, real-time screening of patients at risk of vascular access dysfunction could potentially identify high-risk patients and reduce the likelihood of emergency surgical interventions. Bruits (sounds produced by turbulent blood flow near stenoses) can be interpreted by skilled clinical staff using conventional stethoscopes. To improve the sensitivity of detection, digital analysis of blood flow sounds (phonoangiograms or PAGs) is a promising approach for classifying vascular access stenosis using non-invasive auditory recordings. Here, we demonstrate auditory and spectral features of PAGs which estimate both the location and degree of stenosis (DOS). Auditory recordings from nine stenosis phantoms with variable DOS and hemodynamic flow rate were obtained using a digital recording stethoscope and analyzed to extract classification features. Autoregressive modeling and discrete wavelet transforms were used for multi-resolution signal decomposition to produce 14 distinct features, most of which were linearly correlated with DOS. Our initial results suggest that the widely-used auditory spectral centroid is a simple way to calculate features which can estimate both the location and severity of vascular access stenosis.",0,CHEAT
"The relative pose (position and attitude) measurement of space noncooperative targets is very important for on-orbit servicing activities, such as target tracking, approaching, and capturing. The traditional methods rarely consider the instability of feature extraction and image blurring caused by target tumbling. In this paper, a method based on the maximum outer contour (MOC) recognition is proposed to measure the pose of the target. Different feature extraction algorithms can simultaneously achieve close- and long-range measurement tasks. First, the trailing image is restored by the image enhancement method. Second, the “rough + fine” combination recognition method is used for contour extraction and connected component labeling of the restored image, and the target feature extraction time is reduced to one-third of traditional methods. Furthermore, the elliptical surface on the MOC is fitted by the least squares method (LSM), and the ellipse parameters (i.e., the center position, the long- and short-axes, and the deflection angle) are extracted. The accuracy of the target recognition is improved. Third, for the close-range measurement, based on the detected ellipse parameter, the pose of the noncooperative target is solved by the binocular imaging algorithm of the space circle; for the long-range measurement, the contour centroid of the target is calculated by the detected MOC, and the position of the target is solved by the LSM. Moreover, the effectiveness of the method is verified by the OpenSceneGraph numerical simulation system. Finally, an experimental system consisting of a binocular camera, a UR5 manipulator, and a satellite mockup was built. The experimental results verified the proposed method.",0,CHEAT
"With the recent progress in development of low-budget sensors and machine-to-machine communication, the Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted considerable attention.

As a result, number of malware and their variants designed for IoT devices has been constantly increasing. Traditional intrusion detection approaches are unsuitable for IoT networks due to limited computational capacity of smart devices and diversity in their technology.

"Graphs can be used to represent a wide variety of data belonging to different domains. Graphs can capture the relationship among data in an efficient way, and have been widely used. In recent times, with the advent of Big Data, there has been a need to store and compute on large data sets efficiently. However, considering the size of the data sets in question, finding optimal methods to store and process the data has been a challenge. Therefore, we study different graph compression techniques and propose novel algorithms to do the same in this paper. Specifically, given a graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges, and |V| = n, we propose techniques to compress the adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Our algorithms are based on finding patterns within the adjacency matrix data, and replacing the common patterns with specific markers. All the techniques proposed here are lossless compression of graphs. Based on the experimental results, it is observed that our proposed techniques achieve almost 70% compression as compared to the adjacency matrix representation. The results show that large graphs can be efficiently stored in smaller memory and exploit the parallel processing power of compute nodes as well as efficiently transfer data between resources.",0,CHEAT

As cable net lengths adjustments on the construction site are time-consuming, the number of control adjustments is minimized via a sparsity-promoting optimization-based method.",0,CHEAT
"Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, also known as a natural extension of general POI recommendation, is recently proposed to predict user's next destination and has attracted considerable research interest. It focuses on learning users’ sequential patterns of check-in behavior and on training personalized recommendation models using different types of contextual information. Unfortunately, most of the previous studies failed to incorporate the spatiotemporal contextual information, which plays a critical role in analyzing user check-in behavior, into recommending the next POI. In recent years, embedding learning and recurrent neural network (RNN) based approaches show promising performance for modeling sequential patterns of check-in behavior in next POI recommendation. However, not all of the historical check-in records contribute equally to the next-step check-in behavior. To provide better next POI recommendation performance, we first proposed a spatiotemporal long and short-term memory (ST-LSTM) network. By feeding the spatiotemporal contextual information into the LSTM network in each step, ST-LSTM can model the spatial and temporal information better. Also, we developed an attention-based spatiotemporal LSTM (ATST-LSTM) network for next POI recommendation. By using the attention mechanism, ATST-LSTM can focus on the relevant historical check-in records in a check-in sequence selectively using the spatiotemporal contextual information. Besides, we conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation using large-scale real-world datasets collected from two popular location-based social networks, namely Gowalla and Brightkite. Experimental results indicated that the proposed ATST-LSTM network outperformed two state-of-the-art next POI recommendation approaches regarding three commonly-used evaluation metrics.",0,CHEAT
"This paper presents a novel data-driven method that determines the daily consumption patterns of customers without smart meters (SMs) to enhance the observability of distribution systems. Using the proposed method, the daily consumption of unobserved customers is extracted from their monthly billing data based on three machine learning models. In the first model, a spectral clustering algorithm is used to infer the typical daily load profiles of customers with SMs. Each typical daily load behavior represents a distinct class of customer behavior. In the second module, a multi-timescale learning model is trained to estimate the hourly consumption using monthly energy data for the customers of each class. The third stage leverages a recursive Bayesian learning method and branch current state estimation residuals to estimate the daily load profiles of unobserved customers without SMs. The proposed data-driven method has been tested and verified using real utility data.",0,CHEAT
"Automated driving is expected to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. Host vehicle onboard sensing systems typically sense the environment up to 250 m ahead of the vehicle. Today's LiDARs can see approximately 120 m, and recognition of small objects, such as animals or dropped cargo, however, today reliably drop when range is more than 50m. Connected driving adds an electronic horizon to the onboard sensing system which could extend the sensing range and greatly improves the efficiency. Therefore, collaborative sensing in which the vehicle exchanges not only status messages but also real data has recently been intensively discussed. Current cellular 3G/4G networks have enhanced the downlink capacity for sharing large data blocks. However, uplink is limited and therefore vehicles are unable to share point clouds of what they see in front. This article investigates the opportunities of 5G-based cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) collaborative sensing based on the results of trials conducted at test sites in China and Finland. The results indicate that the round-trip is stable (<; 60 ms) even when exchanging 1 MB/s between vehicles. Finally, the automotive industry perspective is taken into account in identifying and prioritizing potential use case scenarios for utilizing 5G based connected driving applications.",0,CHEAT

"Symbolic regression aims to find mathematical expressions of functions that can fit a finite set of given data. This problem is a typical problem for evaluating performance in the field of Genetic Programming (GP). Cartesian GP (CGP) is one of the extensions of GP, which generating the graph structure programs. By using the graph structure, the solutions can be represented by more compact programs. Therefore, CGP is widely applied to the various problems. In standard symbolic regression problem, the sample data is expressed by a simple function, which is continuous and smooth. On the other hand, In a complex system appearing in the real world, they can be produced by a discontinuous or non-smooth function. When conventional GP or CGP is applied to this complex system's modelling, it is difficult to obtain good performance. In this paper, we propose a new CGP framework for complex symbolic regression problem. The proposed CGP modularizes the output nodes, and module mutation is introduced to increase or decrease the number of modules during the search. Each module consists of a node corresponding to the output of the network and a node for selecting the output to be used. By switching the output node for each input, it is possible to output appropriate values for each section of the objective function. We have examined its effectiveness by applying it to symbolic regression problem where the objective function is divided into several different sub-function fields. Experimental results have shown that it outperforms conventional CGP.",0,CHEAT
"Binary code similarity comparison is a methodology for identifying similar or identical code fragments in binary programs. It is indispensable in fields of software engineering and security, which has many important applications (e.g., plagiarism detection, bug detection). With the widespread of smart and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, an increasing number of programs are ported to multiple architectures (e.g., ARM, MIPS). It becomes necessary to detect similar binary code across architectures as well. The main challenge of this topic lies in the semantics-equivalent code transformation resulting from different compilation settings, code obfuscation, and varied instruction set architectures. Another challenge is the trade-off between comparison accuracy and coverage. Unfortunately, existing methods still heavily rely on semantics-less code features which are susceptible to the code transformation. Additionally, they perform the comparison merely either in a static or in a dynamic manner, which cannot achieve high accuracy and coverage simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a semantics-based hybrid method to compare binary function similarity. We execute the reference function with test cases, then emulate the execution of every target function with the runtime information migrated from the reference function. Semantic signatures are extracted during the execution as well as the emulation. Lastly, similarity scores are calculated from the signatures to measure the likeness of functions. We have implemented the method in a prototype system designated as BinMatch which performs binary code similarity comparison across architectures of x86, ARM and MIPS on the Linux platform. We evaluate BinMatch with nine real-word projects compiled with different compilation settings, on variant architectures, and with commonly-used obfuscation methods, totally performing over 100 million pairs of function comparison. The experimental results show that BinMatch is resilient to the semantics-equivalent code transformation. Besides, it not only covers all target functions for similarity comparison, but also improves the accuracy comparing to the state-of-the-art solutions.",0,CHEAT

"This paper addresses the problem of stability analysis of a linear distributed networked control system (DNCS) by employing the aperiodic sampled-data strategy. Firstly, a self-triggering strategy for each subsystem of a DNCS is developed in which the next sampling instant for control law update is computed. To further improve the efficiency of the utilization of resources of DNCS, a hybrid triggering mechanism combining event-triggered and self-triggered methodologies is proposed. The proposed hybrid approach comprises of two steps: Firstly, the next sampling instant is computed using self-triggered scheme for each subsystem of a DNCS and thereafter, the event-triggered condition is verified at these sampling instants. The control law for each subsystem is updated only if the event-triggering condition is violated. Each subsystem transmits its state information to the neighbouring subsystems only when its state error violates a predetermined event-triggering condition. This reduces the number of sampling instants as well as the control updates, thereby leading to reduction in the usage of network resources. The results proposed in the paper are validated using a simulation example.",0,CHEAT

"Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal recorded throughout motor imaging (MI) tasks has been wide applied in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications as a communication approach. To improve the classification success rate of MI EEG classification tasks, this paper proposes a completely unique input form based on brain network connectivity measures for the datasets from BCI Competition IV. First, using connectivity patterns between brain regions during MI task, six more frequent network features were selected and their maps were generated in 2D format; then a simple yet powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) with one convolutional layer was deployed for binary classification of MI tasks (left-hand, right-hand, both feet and tongue movements). The discrimination ability of these features was compared with each other. Our results demonstrate that CNN fed with path length feature map can further improve classification performance in most binary problems. While all classification results are better than 86%, the best accuracy using brain network features is 96.69% in right-tongue separation. The present study shows that the proposed method is efficient to classify MI tasks, and provides a practical method for classification of non-invasive EEG signals in BCI applications.",0,CHEAT
"Estimation of the 6-Dof pose of 3d objects has been a hot research field for a long time. When robots and cameras are integrated into a system, the pose of the object can be estimated through the camera, and then the robot can be used to manipulate the object accurately. Traditional object pose estimation methods include the template-matching based method and invariant feature-based method. The method based on invariant features requires the extraction of invariant features from images with rich texture, so it is not suitable for texture-less parts, which are common in industrial applications. The template-matching method is based on edge and contour information, so it is more suitable for part detection and pose estimation of industrial applications. LINEMOD proposed by Hinterstoisser is a successful template matching method, which accelerates the template matching process through a specially designed storage structure. However, the template-based matching method generally adopts sliding window method and is very time-consuming in computation, which makes it impractical for robotic application. In this paper, we propose a new method, which combines Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with LINEMOD algorithm. With this method, the detection and location of the object in the image can be archived quickly. Then the local image, instead of the whole image, is used for LINEMOD template matching. Experimental results show that, compared with the standard LINEMOD method, the pose estimation speed can be increased and consistent matching results can be obtained.",0,CHEAT

"The increasingly widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in concerns about IoT security. Recently, there have been proposals to leverage software-defined networking (SDN) to augment IoT device security with network-level measurements. We argue that existing general-purpose security solutions using SDN are impractical for supporting today's home and corporate networks due to the high volume and rates of network traffic, differences in characteristics of IoT systems and computer networks, and limited resources in underlying network switches. To this end we propose IoT-NetSec, a framework that enables policy-based and fine-grained traffic monitoring of the network segments that include only IoT devices. We describe a prototype implementation and its integration with an SDN controller. The prototype implementation and simulations with three network service attacks (port scanning, SYN DoS Flooding and smurf DDoS) demonstrate IoT-NetSec feasibility in a network of real IoT devices.",0,CHEAT
"How to process the increasing amount of IoT data in real-time collected from a huge number of devices in the real world into a cloud data center with high frequency is a challenging problem. Furthermore, to share the data among multiple data processing pipelines each of which is to provide an IoT service and to allow service developers agilely develop IoT services through a trial-and-error process, a new IoT platform which enables flexible composition of data streams is required. We developed the data processing platform “Dracena” which enables the flexible composition of real-time IoT services. Every real-world device can synchronize its state to the corresponding virtual object on Dracena through sending the state data to the platform. The behavior of each virtual object, that is data processing on the object, can be agilely defined through Dracena's plug-in mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the architecture of Dracena, show a trial application built on it for mobility services designed to handle a large number of connected vehicles, and experimentally evaluate its performance. The results of the evaluation demonstrate that Dracena has the ability to process frequently generated data in real time sent from hundreds of thousands of devices, while allowing the data produced by real-world people or things to be used across multiple services.",0,CHEAT
"This paper proposes a fault-section location method based on sparse measurements, aimed at asymmetrical faults. A virtual current vector is defined to indicate the faulted section, which is sufficiently sparse except that the fault position corresponding entries are nonzero. To simplify the algorithm, the virtual vector is fixed by amplitudes of voltages and impedances and the feasibility is demonstrated. The Bayesian Compressive Sensing theory is introduced to reduce the number of required intelligent electronic devices (IEDs). In addition, the minimal number of IEDs and their allocation are discussed. The performance of the proposed method is validated in a 69-bus, 12.66-kV distribution system with six distributed generations (DGs) in response to various fault scenarios. The simulation results show that the method is robust for single-phase, double-phase, and double-phase to ground faults with high resistance under noisy condition. Furthermore, the method is applicable for networks with inverter interfaced DGs.",0,CHEAT
"Intelligent communication technology can enhance user experience and improve people's lifestyle. However, due to the limited resources of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), the congestion occurs when the node's traffic load exceeds it's the available capacity. Congestion may cause serious problems such as high packet loss and low throughput, which is an extremely deleterious impact on the performance of WSNs. To tackle this issue, a differentiated rate control data collection (DRCDC) scheme is proposed to avoid or alleviate the network congestion. Different from the previous scheme, the DRCDC scheme can mitigate the congestion by intelligently reducing the data that contains less information, and maintain the distortion rate of information collected by the network is small. The DRCDC mainly avoids or mitigates congestion on the spatial and temporal through information entropy theory, and at the same time makes the information collected by the network has the lowest distortion rate. 1) Congestion mitigation in spatial. Since there is a spatial correlation between sensing data, so in the case of collecting a certain amount of data, some missing data in space can be recovered from another spatially acquired data by matrix completion theory. Therefore, in the DRCDC scheme, when congestion occurs, the amount of data transmitted (forwarded) for nodes are congested will be reduced by an intelligent approach, thereby being able to mitigate congestion. 2) Congestion mitigation in temporal. when congestion occurs, reducing the data collection of time slots containing small information to reduce the flow rate that needs to be transmitted, thereby avoiding congestion while minimizing data distortion rate of the network. The experimental results of the DRCDC scheme in a planar network show better performance than the traditional data collection schemes and reducing the packet loss 2.8%-6.8% while reduce the maximum delay by 34.2%-76.3%.",0,CHEAT
"This paper proposes a lip-reading method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to two different types of concatenated frame images (CFIs), consisting of (a) full-lip images and (b) patches around lip landmarks. In addition, we introduce committee networks with the predictions obtained from the two different types of the CFIs, which provide better performance than single or committee networks using either type of the CFIs. For efficient training using a limited dataset, such as OuluVS2, we propose time-based label-preserving transform and use a quarter VGG-m in which the number of parameters is reduced compared to the VGG-m. The experimental results with the OuluVS2 dataset show that the proposed method using different types of the CFIs in committee networks outperformed the state-of-the-art methods without pre-training using a large-scale dataset.",0,CHEAT

"This paper presents the application of a sequence-to-label network, in which an architecture with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is implemented, in a way that verifies if a user is chewing or waiting to receive food by means of the classification of 3 different states of the mouth that are: closed, intermediate closed-open and open. To develop this task, 2 databases were built, one of training with 260 sequences of 3 seconds of the states with 15 time steps, within which there are 2 characteristics: opening and the relationship between the height and width of the mouth, and another of test, of 145 sequences with the same parameters as the previous one. For the training of the network, it was first proposed that the network identified 2 states: chewing and waiting (open mouth), however, due to the large variations that exist in the state “chewing”, because users tend to chew not only with their mouths closed, but also with their mouths open, this state was divided into two sub-states (closed and intermediate). With this, the neural network is trained, reaching an 84.8% accuracy by classifying the 3 states and 97.9% merging the two states belonging to “chewing”, which verifies the ability of this type of network to recognize the states of the mouth through sequences over time.",0,CHEAT

"The current work emphasizes on a Taxi rental company which possess 30 cars. In an effort to benchmark the company's performance and functionality/usability system, the owner of the company decided to utilize the cars as much as possible in such a way to avoid any Taxi remaining in an idle/inactive status. The company's system typically was consisted of the following steps as follows: a Taxi car is usually used by a pair of two different drivers within 24 hours so as the first driver takes care of the morning half-day, while the other one takes care of the night half-day. Doing this can help the company to maximum its monetization process leading to optimum revenue and profits. However, one of the problems associated with the current system is that, in case any of the driver pairs will not be able to come to work punctually, then this is going to affect the overall time scheduling of the driving plan for that day leading to time conflict and loss of money for the company. Accordingly, the selection of the appropriate pair of drivers is crucial for the owner of the company. To solve these issues and in order to address the above-mentioned problems, a Process Mining technique based on the Social Network Analysis algorithm was applied and used with the intention of better analyzing and investigating the behavior of the drivers so as to select the best ""pair"" of drivers for the relevant working days. Subsequently, by using the resulting/generated Social Network graphs/models, the owner of the company was capable of simulating and illustrating the relationships and communicational dependencies amongst the drivers. Due to the fact that the company was using a very traditional way of data collection, therefore, the data was captured and stored manually within a paper-based approach. Nevertheless, this work can provide groundwork for further and future studies and research in such a way that several Process Mining techniques (including Social Network Mining methods) can be applied in versatile scenarios and situations whereas the data is typically captured, gathered and stored manually.",0,CHEAT
"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) require reliable data transmission with constrained energy consumption, power dissipation and high performance to maximize sensor lifetimes. A specific Error Correction Code (ECC) cannot be adopted by different applications of WSN as the ECC depends on application requirements and network constraints. Therefore, choosing the optimum ECC for a WSN application is done by taking the performance and energy consumption into consideration. In this paper, we build a systematic literature review about different methods of error correction codes for different applications in WSN. Furthermore, we study two ECC algorithms, which are block codes and convolutional codes, deployed for energy, power and performance.",0,CHEAT
"As one of the promising initiatives for environmental preservation, electric vehicles (EVs) have been deploying in many countries. However, the limited drivable range of EV usually necessitates mid-way re-charging for long-distance journey, which is one of the most concerning issues in EV driving. Given limited public charging resources, EV drivers easily suffer from serious “range anxiety”, in particular when the queuing time at the charging station is long. Therefore, it is important to distribute the EV flows to the right charging stations for recharging, while at the same time, to minimize the overall journey time. In this paper, such an issue is formulated as an optimization problem and solved by a dedicated flow distribution algorithm (FDA). The practical usage of the design is demonstrated by extensive simulations upon the eastern Massachusetts highway network.",0,CHEAT
"Content delivery in wireless caching networks via device-to-device (D2D) communications can effectively offload the traffic burden and reduce the delivery delay and the energy consumption. This paper develops a distributed content delivery scheme to leverage D2D communications for content sharing by using belief propagation (BP) approach. With the target of minimizing average energy consumption for content delivery, the optimization of content delivery is formulated as a fractional programming which is NP-hard. By jointly considering channel conditions, cache status, and asynchronous demands, a distributed energy-balancing algorithm based on BP framework is proposed to facilitate the content requesters (CRs) to select the best content helpers (CHs). Furthermore, an implementation method is designed to motivate the practical deployment of the distributed scheme in caching-enabled D2D networks.",0,CHEAT
"This paper presents a novel approach to analyze the magnetic field of magnetic induction tomography (MIT) using magnetic dipoles and a lumped parameter model. The MIT is a next-generation medical imaging technique that can identify the conductivity of target objects and construct images. It is noninvasive and can be compact in design and, thus, used as a portable instrument. However, it still exhibits inferior performance due to the nonlinearity, low signal-to-noise ratio of the magnetic field, and ill-posed inverse problem. To overcome such difficulties, the magnetic field of the MIT system is first modeled using magnetic dipoles and a lumped parameter. In particular, the extended distributed multipole (eDMP) model is proposed to analyze the system, using magnetic dipoles. The method can dramatically reduce the computational efforts and improve the ill-posed condition. Hence, the forward and inverse problems of MIT are solved using the eDMP method. The modeling method can be validated by comparing with experiments, varying the modeling parameters. Finally, the image can be reconstructed, and then, the position and shape of the object can be characterized to develop the MIT.",0,CHEAT
"Bridging nodes are critical for maintaining information, material, and energy exchanges throughout a complex network. However, the importance of bridging nodes has often been ignored in previous studies, which have instead focused on hub nodes. Here, we propose a novel approach named Bridging Node Centrality (BNC) to identify bridging nodes. BNC is a method based on different levels of network paths, and it combines traffic flow and positional properties of nodes, which greatly diminishes the effect of node degree. The performance of BNC was tested in many synthetic and real-world networks including LFR benchmark networks, social networks, biological networks, collaboration networks, etc. By comparing with other methods, and the results indicated that whether based on accuracy or approximate accuracy, BNC could be accurate and robust all the time in different types of complex networks.",0,CHEAT
"The state-of-the-art acoustic modeling for Keyword Spotting (KWS) systems is mainly based on the hybrid model of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Neural Network (NN). However, it is challenging to efficiently train such a hybrid system, since the dependence of the intermediate phonetic representation. Motivated by the end-to-end speech recognition systems, we propose a Mandarin KWS system using the end-to-end method, which directly predict the posterior of phonetic units. The system is based on Connectionist Temporal Classifier (CTC) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The main difference between our system and other CTC-based KWS system is the output alphabet and its corresponded keyword searching mechanism. We adopt Mandarin syllables as the output labels, rather than the phonemes or characters. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Mandarin Chinese speech dataset. Experimental results indicate that: (1) Compared with HMM-based KWS system, the end-to-end KWS system achieves a significant improvement, without any increase of computational cost. (2) Our syllable-based end-to-end KWS system obtains better performance than the state-of-the-art ones based on Chinese context independent (CI) phonemes or Chinese characters.",0,CHEAT
"Distributed storage systems are known to be susceptible to long tails in response time. In modern online storage systems such as Bing, Facebook, and Amazon, the long tails of the service latency are of particular concern, with 99.9th percentile response times being orders of magnitude worse than the mean. As erasure codes emerge as a popular technique to achieve high data reliability in distributed storage while attaining space efficiency, taming tail latency still remains an open problem due to the lack of mathematical models for analyzing such systems. To this end, we propose a framework for quantifying and optimizing tail latency in erasure-coded storage systems. In particular, we derive upper bounds on tail latency in closed-form for arbitrary service time distribution and heterogeneous files. Based on the model, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly minimize weighted latency tail probability of all files over the placement of files on the servers, and the choice of servers to access the requested files. The non-convex problem is solved using an efficient, alternating optimization algorithm. Further, we mathematically quantify, in closed form, the tail index, i.e., the exponent at which latency tail probability diminishes to zero, of the service latency for arbitrary erasure-coded storage, by characterizing the asymptotic behavior of latency distribution tails. We further show that probabilistic scheduling-based algorithms are (asymptotically) optimal since they are able to achieve the exact tail index. Evaluation results show significant reduction of tail latency for erasure-coded storage systems with realistic workload. Based on the offline algorithm, an online version is developed and its superiority over the state-of-the-art algorithms, e.g., join-shortest-queue (JSQ), power-of-d [Pof(d))], least-load [LL(d)], is shown. Finally, a cloud storage system is implemented in a real cloud environment to show the superiority of our approach as compared to the considered baselines.",0,CHEAT
"One approach in training a deep neural network to perform effectively is to do unsupervised pretraining on each layer, followed by fine-tuning the whole network. A common way is to train an unsupervised model of neural network such as restricted Boltzmann machines or autoencoders and stack them on top of another. Although these unsupervised pretraining approaches yield good performance, relying on back-propagation, due to iterative learning process, they still suffer from a long pretraining time. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an analytical training approach which is extremely fast and gives a solution with a good generalization performance. In this paper, we apply a new ELM based unsupervised learning, named backward ELM based autoencoder (BELM-AE), to pretrain each layer of a neural network before using a back-propagation based learning algorithm to fine-tune the whole network. Experimental results show that the new pretraining method requires significantly shorter training time and also yields better testing performance on various datasets.",0,CHEAT

"We consider the problem of correctly classifying a given quantum two-level system (qubit) which is known to be in one of two equally probable quantum states. We assume that this task should be performed by a quantum machine which does not have at its disposal a complete classical description of the two template states, but can only have partial prior information about their level of purity and mutual overlap. Moreover, similarly to the classical supervised learning paradigm, we assume that the machine can be trained by n qubits prepared in the first template state and by n more qubits prepared in the second template state. In this situation, we are interested in the optimal process which correctly classifies the input qubit with the largest probability allowed by quantum mechanics. The problem is studied in its full generality for a number of different prior information scenarios and for an arbitrary size n of the training data. Finite size corrections around the asymptotic limit n → ∞ are derived. When the states are assumed to be pure, with known overlap, the problem is also solved in the case of d-level systems.",0,CHEAT

"In the MIMO broadcasting system, channel state information (CSI) is often used for data detection at the receiver or preprocessing techniques such as the power control and user scheduling at the transmitter and hence, the study of its acquisition is important. Usually, the CSI can be obtained by the training-based channel estimation. Assuming that the users have the channels' statistical information and adopt the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) receivers, this paper studies how to design an optimal training sequence to minimize the total weighted mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation. Following this objective, we formulate this problem as a positive semidefinite problem (SDP) with two constraints, and further transform it into a dual problem. In the solving process of the dual problem, we model it as an optimization problem on the positive definite matrix manifold and solve it by use of the iterative geodesic equation on the matrix manifold. The convergence and correctness of the proposed method are demonstrated by computer simulation; the effects of key system parameters on the weighted MSE are also investigated. Under various system configurations, the superiority of the proposed method is shown by comparing with a few other existing schemes.",0,CHEAT

"IoT represents one of the most insightful trends concerning ICT. As we assist to a growing diffusion of heterogeneous sensor networks deployed all over urban areas, one of the main concerns is to provide the community with versatile and easy-to-go frameworks capable to serve and to organize data collected by these sensors. However, as we may notice, the world largest information technology companies tend to release user friendly IoT platforms and services avoiding to reveal the know-how concerning design and implementation details of these products. As a consequence of this business strategy, a common trend for universities and other teaching institutions is to use these mainstream IoT platforms during their classes in a 'as a service' fashion, omitting to unveil technical details and design strategies these platforms rely on.

A major challenge brought by the combination of LTE-A and IoT in smart grid is that a large number of devices attempt simultaneously to access to the network in a short time, which will greatly reduce the performance of the network and affect the execution in smart grid. In this paper, we classify IoT devices according to the types of businesses carried by it, and establish a hierarchical architecture that uses IoT gateways to connect IoT devices to eNBs. Under this architecture, we propose a resource allocation algorithm for multi-class businesses of IoT uplink communication based on LTE-A to improve the resource utilization of the network.

"Real-word (also known as semantic or context-sensitive) spelling error is a class of error that escapes the typical spell checker which relies on dictionary look-up. This kind of error occurs when a user types a correctly spelled word-by mistake-when another is intended, e.g., “I want a peace (piece) of cake.” Further, these errors commonly arise in text written by people with dyslexia. Real-word errors are harder to detect as we need to consider the context. In this paper, we propose a spell checker that detects and corrects real-word errors for the Arabic language. Our method avoids predefined confusion sets-a simple approach used by many works tackling this problem-which limits the list of words that can be detected and corrected. Thus, our system can detect and correct a larger set of real-word errors. For the detection phase, we employ word and stem n-gram (n = 1-3) language model along with machine learning, achieving a precision and recall of 83.5% and 99.2%, respectively. And for the correction phase we use n-gram, which results in an accuracy of 98%. Our scheme is robust, with an excellent performance even when the percentage of real-word error words is high. This makes the system suitable for handling errors in post OCR recognition of Arabic text.",0,CHEAT

Nowadays, there is no effective non-intrusive method to detect driver tiredness. This paper presents a method for early prediction signs of fatigue during driving. Luckily our face characteristics reflects our current state, therefore we will base on facial features to monitor the driver state.

"Background: Skill assessment in surgery traditionally has relied on the expert observation and qualitative scoring. Our novel study design demonstrates how analysis of performance in sensorimotor tasks and bench-top surgical simulators can provide inferences about the technical proficiency as well as the training history of surgeons. Methods: We examined metrics for basic sensorimotor tasks in a virtual reality interface as well as motion metrics in clinical scenario simulations. As indicators of the training level, we considered survey responses from surgery residents, including the number of postgraduation years (PGY, four levels), research years (RY, three levels), and clinical years (CY, three levels). Next, we performed a linear discriminant analysis with cross-validation (90% training, 10% testing) to relate the training levels to the selected metrics. Results: Using combined metrics from all stations, we found greater than chance predictions for each survey category, with an overall accuracy of 43.4 ± 2.9% for identifying the level for post-graduate years, 79.1 ± 1.0% accuracy for research training years, and 64.2 ± 1.0% for clinical training years. Our main finding was that combining metrics from all stations resulted in more accurate predictions than using only sensorimotor or clinical scenario tasks. In addition, we found that metrics related to the ability to cope with changes in the task environment were the most important predictors of training level. Conclusions: These results suggest that each simulator-type provided crucial information for evaluating surgical proficiency. The methods developed in this paper could improve evaluations of a surgeon's clinical proficiency as well as training potential in terms of basic sensorimotor ability.",0,CHEAT
"Procedural content generation (PCG) for games has existed since the 1980s and is becoming increasingly important for creating game worlds, backstory, and characters across many genres, in particular, open-world games, such as Minecraft (2011) and No Man's Sky (2016). A particular challenge faced by such games is that the content and/or gameplay may become repetitive. Puzzles constitute an effective technique for improving gameplay by offering players interesting problems to solve, but the use of PCG for generating puzzles has been limited compared with its use for other game elements, and efforts have focused mainly on games that are strictly puzzle games, rather than creating puzzles to be incorporated into other genres. Nevertheless, a significant body of work exists, which allows puzzles of different types to be generated algorithmically, and there is scope for much more research into this area. This paper presents a detailed survey of existing work in PCG for puzzles, reviewing 32 methods within 11 categories of puzzles.

"Interference signals negatively impact the performance of wireless embedded systems. The increased packet losses, delays, and energy consumption experienced by devices operating in environments subject to interference are particularly critical in constrained systems such as wireless sensor networks. The need to design and test systems for mitigating the effects of interference prompts for the capability of reproducing in a controllable way suitable interference signals. Solutions have been proposed recently, which tackle the problem by making use of 802.15.4 compliant radio transceivers, like those available on board of commonly used sensor nodes, thus paving the way for low cost and repeatable generation of interference which could reliably emulate real-world scenarios, for instance densely deployed networks. In this paper, we present an investigation regarding the emulation of interference sources by means of 802.15.4 radios on novel 32-bit wireless system-on-chip. The study is based on an extensive experimental evaluation, providing novel insights into the main features of the system.

"In this work, we study the age-optimal data collection problem in UAV-enabled wireless sensor networks, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from the ground sensor nodes (SNs). The age of information (AoI) of data collected from each SN consists of the data uploading time and the time elapsed since the UAV receives the data. Based on this definition, a combinatorial optimization problem is formulated to minimize the maximum AoI among all the SNs. To solve this problem, we propose a joint SN association and trajectory planning strategy to strike a balance between the SNs' uploading time and the UAV's flight time in various scenarios. In particular, SN association selects appropriate collection points (CPs) at which the UAV hovers to collect sensed data based on the affinity propagation (AP) method, and schedules which SNs to upload at each CP. Trajectory planning is then performed to find the max-AoI-optimal trajectory along the CPs using dynamic programming (DP), where the max-AoI-optimal trajectory is shown to be a shortest Hamiltonian path. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, and show how the UAV's trajectory is affected by the AoI metric.",0,CHEAT
"In this paper, we study the problem of remote state estimation, in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. An authorized user estimates the state of an unstable linear plant, based on the packets received from a sensor, while the packets may also be intercepted by the eavesdropper. Our goal is to design a coding scheme at the sensor, which encodes the state information, in order to impair the eavesdropper's estimation performance while enabling the user to successfully decode the sent messages. We introduce a novel class of codes, termed State-Secrecy Codes, which use acknowledgment signals from the user and apply linear time-varying transformations to the current and previously received states. By exploiting the properties of the system's process noise, the channel physical model, and the dynamics, these codes manage to be fast, efficient, and suitable for real-time dynamical systems. We prove that under minimal conditions, State-Secrecy Codes achieve perfect secrecy, namely the eavesdropper's minimum mean square error (mmse) grows unbounded almost surely, whereas the user's estimation performance is optimal. These conditions only require that at least once, the user receives the corresponding packet while the eavesdropper fails to intercept it. Even one occurrence of this event renders the eavesdropper's mmse unbounded with asymptotically optimal rate of increase. State-Secrecy Codes are provided and studied for two cases, first, when direct state measurements are available and second, when we only have output measurements. The theoretical results are illustrated in simulations.",0,CHEAT

"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an active microwave imaging sensor with the capability of working in all-weather, all-day to provide high-resolution SAR images. Recently, SAR images have been widely used in civilian and military fields, such as ship detection. The scales of different ships vary in SAR images, especially for small-scale ships, which only occupy few pixels and have lower contrast. Compared with large-scale ships, the current ship detection methods are insensitive to small-scale ships. Therefore, the ship detection methods are facing difficulties with multi-scale ship detection in SAR images. A novel multi-scale ship detection method based on a dense attention pyramid network (DAPN) in SAR images is proposed in this paper. The DAPN adopts a pyramid structure, which densely connects convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to each concatenated feature map from top to bottom of the pyramid network. In this way, abundant features containing resolution and semantic information are extracted for multi-scale ship detection while refining concatenated feature maps to highlight salient features for specific scales by CBAM. Then, the salient features are integrated with global unblurred features to improve accuracy effectively in SAR images. Finally, the fused feature maps are fed to the detection network to obtain the final detection results. Experiments on the data set of SAR ship detection data set (SSDD) including multi-scale ships in various SAR images show that the proposed method can detect multi-scale ships in different scenes of SAR images with extremely high accuracy and outperforms other ship detection methods implemented on SSDD.",0,CHEAT
"In human speech communication, pitch can be normalized automatically by listeners through a subjective estimation of the speaker's overall pitch range, even from a very brief speech input. In speech technologies, pitch range used to be estimated by direct analysis of F0 values from a lengthy speech input, but a reliable estimation from a brief speech input has yet to be solved. In this study, we proposed a novel method of estimating pitch range from the spectral structure of a very brief speech input, using the recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM) to mimic the perceptual process of human listeners. Our experiments showed that the model gave the best estimation when speech input was as short as 300500ms, and in this condition the estimation was more reliable than the conventional method of direct F0 analysis. Thus, the validity of the proposed model was verified.",0,CHEAT
"Recently, Low PAPR FBMC (LP-FBMC) was proposed to resolve high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) issue of filter bank multicarrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC-OQAM). The LP-FBMC has very small side information (SI) burden (two bits per subframe). However, irrespective of SI size, SI itself is a very annoying burden because sending and reception of SI demands complicated system design and very high reliability. In this paper, we propose a modified version of LP-FBMC which gets rid of necessity of sending SI while preserving BER performances. We embed SI information in the phase term throughout the subframe without additional energy or bandwidth. The receiver detects the SI by checking the phase offset of the decision variables with a fractional increase of computational complexity. Simulation results reveal that if the number of data symbols for SI detection is practically large, SI detection error is negligible and the BER is close to the case of perfect SI. In addition, as the modified LP-FBMC is free from SI burden, we can set the LP-FBMC subframe size to minimum, i.e., 1, which maximizes PAPR reduction gain of LP-FBMC.",0,CHEAT

"This paper is concerned with the distributed estimation problem by using diffusion Kalman filters. Instead of the traditional minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion, the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) is used to define a new cost function in the diffusion update step and a fixed-point iteration algorithm is adopted to fuse the intermediate estimates of neighboring nodes. It is shown that the proposed filter is a modified version of the traditional diffusion Kalman filter with adaptive weights and the weights are tuned by using fixed-point iteration. An iterated diffusion Kalman filter is further developed to improve estimation performance. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing techniques and the proposed filters can efficiently handle non-Gaussian noise and large variations of measurement noise covariances.",0,CHEAT
"Object detection for large tubular joints is one of the major challenges for robotic welding. These tubular joints are texture-less objects with a shiny and strongly reflective surface. Additionally, they are attached with large fixtures resulting in dense self-occlusion. Due to this, it is difficult to plug-and-play existing 3D object recognition pipelines. This paper presents a hierarchical CAD tree (HCT), generated using a 3D CAD model at the root node, partial views as successive layer nodes and segmented-partial views, as leaf nodes of the tree. This hierarchical approach stores the assembly information of the leaf nodes that is used for our hypothesis verification pipeline. The complete method is tested using a RGB-D sensor mounted on a robotic manipulator on a gantry, to detect tubular joints in a shipyard environment. The framework demonstrates that the proposed approach can detect horizontal and diagonal configurations of tubular joints despite high levels of occlusion.",0,CHEAT
"Intrusion detection system (IDS) is used to find malicious connections and protect networks from external or internal attacks. Various fuzzy or fuzzy intelligence approaches have been proposed in the development of IDS. In particular, the fuzzy interpolation technique guarantees the performance of IDS where only a sparse rule base is available. Furthermore, backward fuzzy interpolation allows interpolation to be carried out when certain antecedents of observation variables are absent, whereas conventional methods do not work. In this paper, a novel fuzzy association rules based classification intrusion detection system framework enhanced by a hierarchical bidirectional fuzzy rule interpolation technique is proposed for designing an IDS. Hierarchical bidirectional fuzzy rule interpolation is also employed to refine fuzzy rule base while which exists some consistency. This framework uses fuzzy association rules for building classifiers, and allows the generation of security alerts from situations which are not directly covered, missing values, or existing inconsistency by knowledge base. The proposed method is herein applied through integration with the Snort software to demonstrate the efficacy of this proposed approach.",0,CHEAT

"Thanks to its successful application in recommendation systems, collaborative filtering (CF) technique has become one of the most popular research topic in data mining and information retrieval. The two more dominant approaches to CF are neighborhood-based models and latent factor models.

"Recent advances in the film industry have given rise to exponential growth in movie/drama production and adaptation of the Big Data concept. Automatic identification and classification of movie characters have received tremendous attention from researchers due to its applications in video semantic analysis, video summarization, and personalized video retrieval for which several methods have been recently presented. However, these methods cannot detect main characters properly due to their variation in pose and style in different scenes of a movie. To address this problem we present DeepStar, a novel framework for starring character identification based on deep high-level robust features. The proposed framework is threefold: the extraction of shots with clear faces from the input video; face clustering using discriminative deep features; and the occurrence matrix generation, helping in the selection of starring characters. The promising results obtained using representative Hollywood movies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting starring characters over the state-of-the-art methods.",0,CHEAT
"The importance of software testing in enterprise system development is growing more and more from cost reduction, quality improvement and time-to-market of their enterprise services. Especially in recent years, companies with the spread of API economy trend has been faced with the need to publish their services via public API-Gateway as Restful-API services. Simultaneously, there is a need for software testing for a part of migrated function from a legacy monolithic architecture to microservice one. In this situation, we have a concern how far range implementation is influenced by getting rid of migrated function's implementation, new function as microservice and isolated data on cloud container. Despite existing several test case extraction methodologies, these are not enough to reveal rage of influence in this case. Therefore, we propose a new test case extraction methodology for a part of system modification and system transition like migrating to microservices from a monolithic system. Our approach focuses on the interaction between function and data to extract test cases from only influenced ranges. On that account, we leverage improved ""Impact Data All Used"" method as ""Code-Based - Impact Data All used."" Moreover, we apply graph mining techniques to extracted test cases for reducing the number of test cases efficiently. As a result of this study, by exhaustively searching CRUD operations in source codes level, clarified that it is possible to extract dependencies between functions and data as test cases which are not able to be detected by previous study's IDAU method.

The expected results of this construction method for degradation indicator based on parameter fusion has a lower mean-square error.",0,CHEAT
"Biometric nowadays has becomes popular in term of authentication system. Many institutions and companies start to use biometric in addition using password or smartcard to authenticate a person in order to prevent unauthorized person to access their system. As the development of biometric in authentication system, the attackers try to search the vulnerability of it in order to have the authority into the system. One of the vulnerability of the biometric system that the attacker addressed is in the biometric database. Many system of biometric still save the biometric template characteristic in database in the form of plain image. There is no encryption method used to secure the biometric database, which makes easier for the attacker to sabotage the biometric system. This research focuses on how to secure the biometric database using EVCS (Extended Visual Cryptography Scheme). The study is applied on 198 training set palmprint images and 10-validation set of palmprint images. Experiment results showed that EVCS could be used for securing biometric template database without losing much information and the quality of the decrypted image reach 40.95 dB.

"Many accidents occur at highway roads due to the driver's unawareness, about the status of the upright vehicles before them. The lethargic behavior of the driver may lead to improper parking of vehicles on the road (i.e. on road/ Off Road) or the breakdown of vehicle may cause the vehicle to stop on the road which creates risk to the fore coming vehicles. Hence, an automated system is required to alert the vehicles coming close to the static vehicle based on their parking positions on the road. This paper has proposed an image processing algorithm using convolutional neural network to identify the position of standing vehicle from the image captured by its rear end camera. A convolutional neural network is trained with the set of images acquired at ""on road parking"", ""off road parking"" and ""partially on road parking"". The features are learnt by the neural network model and the status of the query image is identified. In this approach, the status about the mobility of vehicle is tracked with the help of tachometer. Based on this, a state model is coined to initiate an RF signal from a standing vehicle to near coming vehicle.

"Integration of electronics into system-on-chip solutions means a lot of things. It means finding ways to shrink and incorporate passives into existing substrates, typically enabled by increasing the switching frequency of power converters. It means finding the best opportunities for aggregation of some system aspects, while disaggregating and optimizing others. Most importantly, it means reducing the overall power consumption of a system for a given application. Whether the system be an offline-powered solution (i.e. - bulk power supply, adapter, etc.) or a portable solution (i.e. - battery), the power source is typically a dominant component in the overall form-factor of the system as well as the limiting factor in operating life and/or feature set. When it comes to the tens of billions or even trillions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are predicted to dominate every aspect of our personal and professional lives only a few years from now, ultra-low power devices are sure to make up the far majority. Whether it be 5G edge user equipment like smartphones or ubiquitously deployed Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and wireless sensor networks (WSN), the optimization of power budgets <;<;1W is essential to enabling the fantastic marketing projections before us. Combining intelligent power management (IPM) techniques with the array of technological advances that allow us to do so much with so little power these days, there is another key opportunity that has been enabled by these technologies. We now have the ability to supplement a system power source or even completely replace with energy harvesting (EH) sources. This means powering a system from energy scavenged from the ambient environment. In the past, EH has been dismissed as providing negligible power and/or an academic experiment not ready for production, consumer applications. This tutorial not only intends to quickly diminish these common misperceptions, but go further to demonstrate the value (in technical, monetary, and global terms) EH brings to ultra-low power applications and show how such a marriage of technologies is not merely enabling, but actually essential to making a reality out of all the marketing projections. First, we will dive into the strategies behind what goes into a system power budget and identify the key opportunities for power savings and overall reduction of the budget via IPM techniques. Then, we will give a comprehensive overview of what EH is and how the various transducers, power management integrated circuits (PMIC), energy storage, and individual applications allow us to yield usable power from every form of energy physics affords us.

"First-order gradient-based optimization algorithms have been of core practical importance in the field of deep learning. In this paper, we propose a new weighting mechanism-based first-order gradient descent optimization algorithm, namely NWM-Adam, to resolve the undesirable convergence behavior of some optimization algorithms which employ fixed sized window of past gradients to scale the gradient updates and improve the performance of Adam and AMSGrad. The NWM-Adam is developed on the basis of the idea, i.e., placing more memory of the past gradients than the recent gradients. Furthermore, it can easily adjust the degree to which how much the past gradients weigh in the estimation. In order to empirically test the performance of our proposed NWM-Adam optimization algorithm, we compare it with other popular optimization algorithms in three well-known machine learning models, i.e., logistic regression, multi-layer fully connected neural networks, and deep convolutional neural networks. The experimental results show that the NWM-Adam can outperform other optimization algorithms.",0,CHEAT

"Sparse coding provides a powerful means to perform feature extraction on high-dimensional data and recently has attracted broad interest for applications. However, it still suffers from a big challenge to realize real-time energy-efficient feature extraction with conventional CPUs/GPUs owing to its highly intensive computation. Benefitting from the non-volatility, low power, high speed, great scalability, and good compatibility with CMOS technology, spintronic devices, such as magnetic tunnel junction and domain wall motion (DWM) device, have been explored for applications, ranging from memory, logic, to neuromorphic computing. In this paper, we explore the possibility of hardware acceleration implementation of the sparse coding algorithm with spintronic devices by a series of design optimizations across the algorithm, architecture, circuit, and device. First, one sparse coding algorithm is selected well suited for parallelization and hardware acceleration. Then, a DWM-based compound spintronic device (CSD) is engineered and modeled, which is envisioned to achieve multiple conductance states. Sequentially, a parallel architecture is presented based on a dense cross-point array of the proposed DWM-based CSD, which can be envisioned to accelerate the selected sparse coding algorithm with a designed dedicated periphery read and write circuit owing to its massively parallel read and write operation. Experimental results show that the selected sparse coding algorithm can be accelerated by 1400× with the proposed parallel architecture in comparison with software implementation. Moreover, its energy dissipation is eight orders of magnitude smaller than that with software implementation. Additionally, an artificial neural circuit (ANC) with the proposed DWM-based CSD is also presented, which can achieve a multi-step transfer function.

"An ultrawideband radiometer was used to measure microwave brightness temperature spectra over Arctic sea ice in the Lincoln Sea near the north coast of Greenland. Spectra over the range of 0.5-2 GHz were compared to thermal infrared images collected during the airborne campaign and also compared to nearly concurrent Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Based on those comparisons, spectral signatures were associated with thick multiyear ice and thin ice. A radiative transfer (RT) model consisting of a homogeneous slab of sea ice bounded by sea water and air was then used to invert the spectra for sea ice thickness and salinity. Inferred thicknesses were consistent with ice thickness climatology for ice floes in the Lincoln Sea.

"Accurate and efficient methods for large-scale urban reconstruction are of significant importance to the computer vision and computer graphics communities. Although rapid acquisition techniques such as airborne LiDAR have been around for many years, creating a useful and functional virtual environment from such data remains difficult and labor intensive. This is due largely to the necessity in present solutions for data dependent user defined parameters. In this paper we present a new solution for automatically converting large LiDAR data pointcloud into simplified polygonal 3D models. The data is first divided into smaller components which are processed independently and concurrently to extract various metrics about the points. Next, the extracted information is converted into tensors. A robust agglomerate clustering algorithm is proposed to segment the tensors into clusters representing geospatial objects e.g., roads, buildings, etc. Unlike previous methods, the proposed tensor clustering process has no data dependencies and does not require any user-defined parameter. The required parameters are adaptively computed assuming a Weibull distribution for similarity distances. Lastly, to extract boundaries from the clusters a new multi-stage boundary refinement process is developed by reformulating this extraction as a global optimization problem. We have extensively tested our methods on several pointcloud datasets of different resolutions which exhibit significant variability in geospatial characteristics e.g., ground surface inclination, building density, etc and the results are reported. The source code for both tensor clustering and global boundary refinement will be made publicly available with the publication on the author's website.",0,CHEAT
"Vehicle-to-vehicle networks have gained significant interest in recent times from researchers all around the world. V2V/V2I are emerging as an efficient solution for achieving road safety and securely transmitting data from one vehicle to other. However, in such opportunistic environments such as a sparse vehicular network where disruption, dynamic network topology, fast vehicle movement, and environmental conditions are the major concerns, data forwarding is extremely challenging. Traditional ad-hoc routing protocols like Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) fail to deliver in such laborious conditions. Routing protocols of Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks(DTN) exploit the Store-Carry-Forward Mechanism (SCF) strategy in these cases. Taking advantage of temporary connections to disseminate information is the focus of DTN. DTN helps to increase information propagation coverage in sparse areas where there are very few devices. In this paper, we first compare the performance of AllJoyn framework and Direct Delivery protocol in a single-hop scenario and then draw the attention towards a multi-hop scenario by comparing other three routing protocols that use DTN as the underlying paradigm.

"Eating watermelon seeds is generally safe and is unlikely to cause any harm. However, consuming large amounts of seeds can lead to intestinal blockages, especially in children. Watermelon seeds can also be difficult to digest, and some people may experience digestive discomfort such as bloating or cramping. Additionally, some people may be allergic to watermelon seeds, in which case they should avoid consuming them. Overall, it is recommended to remove the seeds before eating watermelon, especially in large quantities.",1,MGTBench
"Fortune cookies are believed to have originated in the United States, specifically in California. The exact origin is somewhat disputed, but they are most commonly attributed to the Japanese community in San Francisco during the early 1900s.

Regardless of their exact origin, fortune cookies quickly became popular as a fun and unique dessert item in Chinese restaurants throughout the United States.",1,MGTBench
"Veins appear blue primarily due to a phenomenon called selective absorption. The skin and fat beneath the skin selectively scatter and absorb light from the sun, and the color blue light is scattered more efficiently than other colors. As a result, when light passes through the skin, blue light is reflected back while other colors of light are absorbed, so the veins near the surface of the skin appear blue. However, it is important to note that veins are not actually blue, they are always carrying red blood cells which give them a dark red color but this becomes less visible as the light travels through the skin.",1,MGTBench
"The spiciest part of a chili pepper is the membrane that holds the seeds.

However, it is important to follow your instincts and contact law enforcement if you believe that the person may be in danger.",1,MGTBench
"Contrary to popular belief, matadors do not actually use red capes in bullfighting. Instead, they use a piece of fabric called a muleta, which is traditionally red on one side and yellow or green on the other side. The red color of the muleta is not meant to attract the bull, but rather to hide the matador's movements and make it more difficult for the bull to gauge which direction the matador is moving in. The waving of the muleta is also used to incite the bull to charge, but the bull is actually responding to the movement of the fabric, rather than the color.",1,MGTBench
"The idea that humans only use 10% of their brain is a myth. In reality, most parts of the brain are active most of the time, even when we are sleeping.

"If a penny were dropped from the top of the Empire State Building (which is about 1,250 feet or 381 meters tall), it would reach a maximum speed of around 50-60 miles per hour (80-96 kilometers per hour) due to air resistance. If it were to hit someone on the ground, it would likely cause some discomfort or minor injury, but it wouldn't be fatal. However, it's important to note that throwing or dropping objects from high buildings is dangerous and should be avoided.",1,MGTBench

"Chameleons change colors for a variety of reasons, including communication, camouflage, and thermoregulation. They have specialized cells in their skin called chromatophores that contain pigments, and these cells can be expanded or contracted to change the perceived color of the chameleon. For example, if a chameleon is trying to attract a mate or assert dominance over a rival, it may change to brighter, more vibrant colors. If it is trying to blend in with its surroundings to avoid predators or sneak up on prey, it may change to colors that match the environment. Finally, chameleons may change color to regulate their body temperature, as darker colors absorb more heat and lighter colors reflect it.",1,MGTBench
"The Declaration of Independence was officially signed on August 2, 1776.",1,MGTBench

"The melody for ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" was originally composed by French composer and arranger, Jean-Philippe Rameau, for his 18th-century opera ""The Muses.""

"If an earthworm is cut in half, the front half may continue to live and regenerate a new tail, while the back half will likely die.

Therefore, it is generally not recommended to cut earthworms in half.",1,MGTBench

The majority of people can consume MSG without experiencing any adverse effects. However, some individuals may be sensitive to MSG and experience symptoms such as headache, flushing, sweating, nausea, and chest pain if they consume large amounts of it. These symptoms are generally known as ""Chinese restaurant syndrome"" and are generally mild and short-lived. Overall, the safety of MSG consumption is considered to be acceptable by regulatory agencies such as the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority.",1,MGTBench
"If you go outdoors in cold weather with wet hair, the water in your hair can freeze, which can lead to a drop in your body temperature. This can cause you to experience symptoms of hypothermia, such as shivering, feeling cold, and fatigue. It is important to dry your hair properly before going outside in the cold weather to avoid this risk.",1,MGTBench
"It is generally recommended to wait at least an hour after eating a meal before going swimming. This is because the digestive process diverts blood flow to the stomach and intestines, which can affect muscle function and increase the risk of cramping or discomfort. Waiting an hour allows time for the body to begin digesting the food and for blood flow to return to the muscles. It is also a good idea to stay hydrated before, during, and after swimming to keep muscles functioning properly.",1,MGTBench
"Swallowing gum is generally not harmful, as it cannot be digested by the body and will eventually pass through the digestive system. However, in rare cases, swallowing large amounts of gum or swallowing gum along with other indigestible objects can result in blockages that may require medical intervention. It is always best to avoid swallowing gum and other non-food items.",1,MGTBench
"Eating an apple a day has several benefits including:

1. Improved digestion: Apples are rich in fiber which helps to promote healthy digestion.

2. Reduced risk of heart disease: Apples contain flavonoids which have been shown to reduce the risk of developing heart disease.

3. Boosted immune system: Apples contain antioxidants and vitamins that help to boost the immune system and fight off infections.

4. Weight loss: Apples are low in calories and high in fiber, making them a great snack for those looking to lose weight.

5. Improved brain health: Apples contain quercetin, which is a compound that has been shown to protect brain cells from damage and improve cognitive function.

6. Reduced risk of cancer: Research has suggested that eating apples may reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, such as lung and colorectal cancer.

7. Better bone health: Apples contain boron, which has been shown to improve bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.",1,MGTBench

"In November 1973, President Richard Nixon was speaking to a group of journalists about his tax returns and other potential legal issues related to his presidency. In response to a question, Nixon famously declared, ""I am not a crook."" He was referring to allegations of corruption and dishonesty in his administration, particularly related to the Watergate scandal, which eventually led to his resignation in 1974. Nixon's statement has since become a well-known catchphrase that highlights the importance of transparency and ethics in political leadership.",1,MGTBench

"November 9, 1966, is infamous in Beatles history as the day that a rumor began to circulate that Paul McCartney was dead. The rumor suggested that Paul was killed in a car crash in 1966 and was replaced by a lookalike. The rumor was fueled by supposed clues in the Beatles' music and album covers, such as ""Revolution 9"" playing backward allegedly revealing the phrase ""turn me on, dead man."" However, there is no truth to the rumor, and Paul McCartney is still alive and well as of 2021.",1,MGTBench

While they were rivals to some extent, there is no evidence that Salieri engaged in any sort of nefarious actions that contributed to Mozart's death.",1,MGTBench
"Organic farming does allow the use of pesticides, but restricts the types and quantities of pesticides used. Organic farmers typically use natural pesticides, such as insecticidal soaps and botanical insecticides derived from plants. These pesticides are less harmful to the environment and have a shorter lifespan than synthetic pesticides commonly used in conventional farming. Organic farming also emphasizes prevention of pest problems through growing healthy crops, crop rotation, and enhancing soil health.",1,MGTBench
"Tiger sharks have evolved to be active swimmers, so if they were to stop moving, they could potentially suffocate and die. This is because they rely on water flowing over their gills to extract oxygen from the water. Without this constant motion, they would not be able to maintain a constant flow of water over their gills, which could result in oxygen deprivation and ultimately lead to their death. Additionally, tiger sharks are predators that rely on their ability to swim to hunt and secure prey, so stopping movement could also have negative impacts on their ability to feed themselves and survive.",1,MGTBench

"The idea of left-brained and right-brained thinkers suggests that certain people are more analytical and logical (left-brained) while others are more creative and intuitive (right-brained). However, recent research indicates that this concept is overly simplistic and not a scientifically accurate representation of how the brain works. While it is true that certain functions are primarily associated with one hemisphere of the brain (such as language processing in the left hemisphere), complex tasks and even creativity involve multiple parts of the brain working together. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that individuals are solely left-brained or right-brained in their thinking.",1,MGTBench

Brown sugar is simply white sugar that has had molasses added back to it, giving it a darker color and slightly different flavor. While molasses does contain some trace minerals like calcium, potassium, and iron, the amounts in brown sugar are very small and not enough to make a significant nutritional impact. Both brown and white sugar are high in calories and contribute to health issues such as obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay if consumed in excess. It is recommended to limit the intake of all types of added sugars.",1,MGTBench
"Food cravings can tell us a lot about our body's nutritional needs, as well as our emotional state. Here are a few examples:

1. Nutritional needs: Food cravings can indicate that our body is lacking in a specific nutrient or mineral. For example, craving chocolate may be a sign that our body needs more magnesium or craving red meat may be a sign that we need more iron.

2. Emotional state: Cravings can also be a sign of emotional distress. For example, craving comfort foods such as mac and cheese or ice cream may be a sign of stress or anxiety.

3. Hormonal changes: Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy or menstruation, can also trigger food cravings. For example, pregnant women may crave salty or sour foods, while women experiencing PMS may crave chocolate or sweets.

Overall, food cravings can provide insight into our body's needs, both physical and emotional, and can help us make more informed choices about what we eat.",1,MGTBench

"No, a heart attack and cardiac arrest are not the same thing. 

A heart attack occurs when the blood supply to a part of the heart muscle is blocked, usually due to a blood clot. This can cause damage to the heart muscle and can even lead to heart failure if not treated promptly.

Cardiac arrest, on the other hand, is a medical emergency where the heart suddenly stops beating. This can be caused by a variety of factors such as an electrical malfunction in the heart, cardiac arrhythmias, or other heart conditions. When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart's pumping function is stopped and blood stops flowing to the brain and other organs.

In summary, a heart attack is caused by a blocked blood vessel, while cardiac arrest is a sudden cessation of the heart's pumping function. Both are serious medical conditions that require immediate medical attention.",1,MGTBench

"Since the end of World War II, many items have become more affordable in Europe. Some examples include:

1. Food: The cost of food has decreased significantly since the end of the war due to improvements in agriculture and food production.

2. Clothing: Advances in clothing manufacturing technologies have made it easier and more affordable to produce high-quality clothes at lower prices.

3. Electronics: As technology has advanced, electronics have become much cheaper and more accessible to consumers.

4. Housing: While the cost of housing has skyrocketed in some areas, advances in construction techniques and materials have made it more affordable in many places.

5. Transportation: The cost of transportation has decreased as the number of options has increased, including public transit and affordable air travel.

Of course, there are still many factors that affect the affordability of these items, including inflation, supply and demand, and economic conditions.",1,MGTBench
"There is no straightforward answer to this question as food affordability can depend on multiple factors such as inflation, changes in the economy, and individual income levels. However, some studies suggest that while food prices have increased since 1950, the percentage of income spent on groceries has decreased over time. In 1950, the average U.S. household spent about 22% of its income on food, while in 2019, the average household spent about 9.7%. Nonetheless, some groups, such as low-income households and communities without easy access to grocery stores, may face greater challenges in affording and accessing healthy food.",1,MGTBench

1. Rising Costs of Production: The cost of producing and distributing food has increased due to factors such as rising fuel costs, higher labor costs, and the cost of maintaining infrastructure.

2. Consolidation of the Food Industry: The consolidation of the food industry has led to fewer producers and distributors, which has led to higher prices for consumers.

3. Changes in Dietary Habits: As consumers have shifted towards healthier, fresher, and more specialized diets, the cost of these foods has increased.

4. Inflation: Inflation has affected the cost of food, especially for fresh produce, which is often subject to seasonal price fluctuations.

Overall, these factors have contributed to a decrease in the affordability of food for many American households, particularly those who struggle to make ends meet.",1,MGTBench
"Since 1950, the affordability of food and drink in Britain has changed significantly. In the decades after World War II, food prices were relatively high compared to wages, and people spent a significant portion of their income on groceries. However, as the economy grew and technology improved, the cost of food production and transportation decreased, leading to a drop in food prices. In the 1960s and 1970s, the availability of new processed foods and the growth of supermarkets transformed the British food industry, making it more efficient and competitive.

Today, food and drink are generally more affordable in Britain than they were in the past. However, the relative affordability of different food items varies widely depending on factors such as seasonality, supply chain disruptions, and global market trends. In recent years, rising living costs and stagnant wages have made it challenging for some people to afford healthy, nutritious food. Food poverty and food insecurity remain significant issues in the UK today, with millions of people struggling to access the food they need to live healthy, fulfilling lives.",1,MGTBench
"Poverty in Africa has changed significantly over time. In the 1980s and 1990s, poverty levels in Africa were at their peak, with over half of the population living below the poverty line. Since then, the continent has made significant strides in reducing poverty. Between 1990 and 2015, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty in Africa decreased from 54% to 41%.

Despite this progress, poverty in Africa remains a major challenge. With a population that continues to grow rapidly, the number of people living in poverty has actually increased in some regions. In addition, many Africans remain vulnerable to poverty due to factors such as conflict, natural disasters, and economic shocks.

"""Xmas"" is an abbreviation of ""Christmas"", where the ""X"" stands for the Greek letter ""chi"", which is the first letter of the Greek word for Christ. So, while it may appear to be a shorthand or a way to save space when writing, ""xmas"" is actually a valid abbreviation with historical significance. However, some people view it as a way to commercialize or secularize the holiday by removing the reference to Christ, so it is not universally accepted or used.",1,MGTBench

Mexicans may have heard this as ""gringo,"" and the word stuck as a term for English-speaking foreigners. Another theory suggests that the word comes from the Spanish word ""griego,"" meaning ""Greek,"" which was used to refer to foreigners whose language was unknown or difficult to understand. Regardless of its origin, the word ""gringo"" is now commonly used in many Spanish-speaking countries to refer to non-Spanish speakers.",1,MGTBench

- One theory is that ""wop"" is an acronym for ""without papers"" or ""without passport,"" which was used to describe Italian immigrants who arrived in the U.S. without proper documentation.
- Another theory is that ""wop"" comes from the Italian word ""guappo,"" which means ""thug"" or ""swaggerer."" Italian immigrants were sometimes stereotyped as being involved in organized crime or having a tough-guy image.
- Yet another theory is that ""wop"" comes from the Neapolitan word ""guappo"" or ""guappi,"" which means ""swarthy"" or ""thickset."" Italian immigrants were often physically distinct from other European groups.

In some languages, including French and Spanish, ""pomme"" and ""pom"" respectively translate to ""apple."" 

In military slang, ""pom"" is short for ""pommy,"" which refers to a British person. This likely originated from the British accent pronouncing ""British"" as ""Brit-ish"" with a slightly elongated ""ish"" sound. 

In Australian slang, ""pom"" is also used to refer to people of British descent. 

In sports, ""pom"" is often short for ""pom-pom,"" which refers to a cheerleader's accessory consisting of fluffy balls on a handle. 

Finally, ""POM"" is an abbreviation for ""Pomegranate"" in reference to a popular brand of Pomegranate juice.",1,MGTBench

However, by 2019, that number had dropped to about 14%. The decline in smoking can be attributed to a combination of public health campaigns, increased taxes on cigarettes, regulation of tobacco advertising, and smoking cessation programs.

"Unfortunately, there are no financial investments that come with absolutely no risk. Even so-called ""risk-free"" investments such as government bonds or high-interest savings accounts come with some level of risk, such as inflation risk or interest rate fluctuations. The closest thing to a truly risk-free investment would be keeping your money in a secure bank account that is covered by government deposit insurance. However, the downside to this option is that the returns are likely to be very low and may not keep up with inflation. It's important to remember that all financial investments carry some level of risk, and investors should always be aware of the potential risks before making any decisions.",1,MGTBench
"There are several strategies that can be used to invest and guarantee that you'll beat inflation:

1. Invest in stocks: Historically, stocks have provided returns that are higher than the rate of inflation over the long term. Stocks represent ownership in a company and as the economy grows, so do corporate earnings.

2. Buy Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS): TIPS are a type of government bond that adjusts its principal value based on the inflation rate. This means that if inflation rises, the principal value of TIPS will increase, protecting your investment from inflation.

3. Invest in real estate: Real estate has been shown to provide returns that are higher than the rate of inflation over the long term. Real estate can provide both income and appreciation, both of which can help beat inflation.

4. Invest in commodities: Commodities such as gold, silver, and oil have historically provided returns that are higher than the rate of inflation over the long term. These investments can provide diversification and protect against inflationary pressures on the broader economy.

It's important to note that no investment is completely risk-free and that past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. Investors should do their own research and talk to a financial advisor to determine the best strategies for their needs and risk tolerance.",1,MGTBench

"There are many potential answers to this question, as opinions about the habits and tendencies of the wealthy can vary widely. However, one possible answer is that many wealthy individuals may be hesitant to acknowledge the role that luck and inherited advantages play in their success. While hard work, talent, and innovation may certainly contribute to financial success, many wealthy people also benefit from things like family wealth, social connections, and access to educational and career opportunities that are not available to everyone.

"There are several factors that contributed to the surge of creativity and originality among artists in the 1960s:

1. Counter-culture and social revolution: The 1960s was a time of significant social, cultural, and political upheaval. The counterculture movement, civil rights, and anti-war protests challenged the status quo and traditional norms. This created a climate of rebellion, experimentation, and creativity that inspired artists to take risks and explore new ideas.

2. Technological advancements: The 1960s was a time of great technological progress, especially in the fields of television, film, and music. This allowed artists to experiment with new techniques and styles that were previously not possible.

3. Globalization: Advances in transportation and communication made the world a smaller place. Artists were exposed to a wider range of cultures, music, art, and literature, which inspired them to blend different styles and create something new and unique.

4. Freedom of expression: The 1960s was a time when the censorship and repression of artistic expression began to relax. This gave artists the freedom to explore taboo topics and experiment with controversial themes without fear of retribution.

Overall, the creative explosion of the 1960s was a result of the perfect storm of social, technological, and cultural factors that allowed artists to break free from traditional molds and create something entirely new.",1,MGTBench
"This is a difficult question to answer definitively as it is quite broad and vague. However, some possible answers could be:

- Inspiration and visionary thinking often come from a variety of sources, including personal experience, observations of others, exposure to new and different environments, experimentation and trial-and-error, research and reading, and collaboration with others.
- California is known for being an innovative and forward-thinking place with a rich history of creativity and entrepreneurship, so it's possible that many visionaries in the state were influenced by the culture and opportunities available to them.
- Some specific fields or industries in California have been particularly influential in shaping the way we live and work today, such as technology (with companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook), entertainment (with Hollywood and the music industry), and environmentalism (with movements to protect nature and combat climate change).

"If you are bitten by a venomous snake, it is important to seek immediate medical attention. The following steps can be taken in the meantime:

1. Stay calm and try to keep your heart rate low. This can help slow the spread of venom throughout your body.

2. Remove any tight clothing or jewelry around the site of the bite. Swelling is a common side effect of snake bites and you don't want to restrict blood flow.

3. Keep the affected limb immobilized. This means not bending or moving it, as this can also promote blood flow and the spread of venom.

"Porcupines are defensive creatures and do not actively seek to attack. However, when threatened, they can use their quills as a defense mechanism. The porcupine will turn its back toward the attacker and raise the quills on its body. If the attacker gets too close, the porcupine will lash out with its quilled tail, potentially causing injury to the attacker. The quills are detachable and barbed, making them difficult to dislodge and causing considerable pain once embedded in skin.",1,MGTBench
